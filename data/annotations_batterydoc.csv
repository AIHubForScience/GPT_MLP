"Background Allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates present in the workplace is a disease frequently reported among dentists, printers, and fiberglass workers. Recently, the number of cases of contact allergic dermatitis among beauticians specialized in sculpting artificial nails has increased. Objective Our objective was to study the clinical characteristics and allergens implicated in allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates in beauticians and users of sculpted nails. Material and methods This was an observational, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates used in sculpting artificial nails over the last 26 years in the Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain. Results In total, 15 patients were diagnosed: 14 beauticians and 1 client. Most cases were diagnosed in the past 2 years. All were women, their mean age was 32.2 years, and 26.7% had a personal or family history of atopy. The sensitization time varied between 1 month and 15 years. The most frequently affected areas were the fleshy parts of the fingers and hands. Three patients ??2 beauticians and 1 client?? presented allergic asthma due to acrylates. All patients underwent patch testing with a standard battery of allergens and a battery of acrylates. The most frequent allergens were ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (13/15, 86.7%), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (13/15, 86.7%), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (7/15, 46.7%), 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (5/15, 33.3%), and methyl methacrylate (5/15, 33.3%). Conclusions Acrylate monomers used for sculpting artificial nails are important sensitizers for contact and occupational dermatitis. The most important consideration is primary and secondary prevention.",non-battery
"ABSTRACT According to the Nernst??Planck equation, the transport of charged species in porous electrodes is mainly driven by diffusion and migration. Although a number of all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) models have been developed by several VRFB modeling groups, a comparative study of these two ion transport mechanisms has not been clearly reported in the literature. In this study, we develop a three-dimensional (3-D), transient VRFB model that rigorously accounts for both diffusion and migration mechanisms of charged species, including V2+, V3+, VO2+,VO2 + and H+. The VRFB model relies upon five principles of conservation: mass, momentum, species, electric charge, and thermal energy. Due to the general form of the conservation equations, both species migration effects on species transport and species diffusion effects on charge transport are considered in the source terms of the model equations. The model calculates species migration and diffusion fluxes through the membrane and compares their relative magnitudes under various charging and discharging stages. This paper clearly elucidates the role of species migration on vanadium crossover and the subsequent capacity losses, demonstrating that the present VRFB model is a valuable tool for optimizing the component design and operation of VRFBs.",battery
"Carbon-encapsulated nano-MnO composite with novel multiple structure loaded on N-doped carbon webs (CMNCWs) has been designed and fabricated by using polypyrrole webs as both template and precursor. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, CMNCWs exhibit a superhigh reversible capacity and excellent rate capability, delivering a capacity as high as 1268mAhg???1 after 700 cycles at a current density of 1.0Ag???1. Such superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique multiple structure, which cannot only effectively shorten the transport path of Li+ ions and enhance the conductivity, but also relieve the volume change and prevent agglomeration of Mn grains during the phase transformation in the conversion reaction.",battery
"Search for simple and economical electrocatalyst for the hydrogen gas evolution reaction (HER), which can resemble to the performance of Pt and other precious metals, is a challenging research interest. In this work, a systematic effect of pre-treatment potential of screen-printed carbon (SPCE) surface on the HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 was carried out. A new observation of a low potential HER (onset potential, E onset = ???0.02 V vs. RHE) at a cathodic potential, ???0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl on 1 hr pre-treated screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE*, * = pre-treated) was observed. Physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations of the SPCE* by field emission scanning electron-microscope, Raman, IR and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopes reveals specific generation of carboxylic acid functionalized carbon surface and in turn for the enhanced HER on the modified electrode surface. Electrochemical characterization of SPCE* with Fe(CN)6 3??? support the observation. A marked decrement in the peak current and significant increase in the peak-to-peak separation potential response due electrostatic repulsion between the anion sites of Fe(CN)6 3??? and ??COO?? were noticed. This observation is in parallel with the reduced electrical double layer capacitance value of the SPCE* system. The E onset and Tafel value (54.7 mV dec???1) obtained here are comparable to those at Pt, MoS2, MoSe2 and superior over the N- and P-doped graphene/carbon electrocatalysts for HER. A prototype HER system was developed and demonstrated for H2 gas production at a rate of 0.0053 ??M s???1 (Operating potential = ???0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl), which is comparable to that of precious metal and metal compound electrocatalysts based HER performance.",battery
"The frequent occurrence of natural disasters is a major threat to the property and casualties of human beings in recent decades. Disaster prone points can be very closely monitored by augmenting the distribution of wireless sensor networks. However, replacing the battery of electronics regularly remains a significant challenge especially in a remote area. In this study, we report a wind-driven hybridized energy harvester which is designed for rotating energy harvesting and can be integrated with WSN technology to develop a self-powered natural disaster monitoring system. In this harvester, the rotator is directly driven by external rotational motion thus can easily hybridize the TENG with eighteen EMGs. Consequently, the fully packaged WH-EH device combining with the water-proof flexible solar cell can be completely isolated from the harsh wilderness environment. The output feature of TENG of high voltage but low current that perfectly compensate for the differing performance of EMG to achieve an excellent output power of the hybrid device with a broad frequency range. Moreover, the WH-EH is capable of lighting hundreds of LEDs and powering small electronics. The quick-acting charging ability of a capacitor by the WH-EH was conducted effectively in experimental tests. Finally, three self-powered sensor systems enabled by a single WH-EH were discussed and demonstrated, including a temperature sensor for forest fire detection, a vibration sensor for earthquake monitoring and a wireless transceiver for alarm information spreading. Obviously, the invention of the hybridized nanogenerator will be of great importance to promote the development of self-powered wireless sensor networks and provide a sustainable power-supply solution to long-term natural disaster monitoring stations in residential or remote areas.",battery
"Polymeric gel electrolytes (PGE), based on polyacrylonitrile blended with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VdF-co-HFP)), which are reinforced with glass-fibre cloth (GFC) to increase the mechanical strength, are prepared for the practical use in lithium secondary batteries. The resulting electrolytes exhibit electrochemical stability at 4.5V against lithium metal and a conductivity value of (2.0??2.1)??10???3 Scm???1 at room temperature. The GFC??PGE electrolytes show excellent strength and flexibility when used in batteries even if they contain a plasticiser. A test cell with LiCoO2 as a positive electrode and mesophase pich-based carbon fibre (MCF) as a negative electrode display a capacity of 110mAhg???1 based on the positive electrode weight at the 0.2C rate at room temperature. Over 80% of the initial capacity is retained after 400 cycles. This indicates that GFC is suitable as a reinforcing material to increase the mechanical strength of gel-based electrolytes for lithium secondary batteries.",battery
"Actigraphy has been used for more than 60??years to objectively measure sleep??wake rhythms. Improved modern devices are increasingly employed to diagnose sleep medicine disorders in the clinical setting. Although less accurate than polysomnography, the chief advantage of actigraphs lies in the cost-effective collection of objective data over prolonged periods of time under everyday conditions. Since the cost of wrist actigraphy is not currently reimbursed, this method has not enjoyed wide acceptance to date. The present article provides an overview of the main clinical applications of actigraphy, including the recommendations of specialist societies.

"Photoelectrocatalytic cells for water splitting should combine one or two photosensitive units with a water oxidation catalyst at the anode and a hydrogen evolution catalyst at the cathode. In this perspective article, we first show how a chemist can take the naturally occurring multi-electron catalysts for these two electro- and photochemical reactions, photosystem II and hydrogenases, as a source of inspiration for the design of original, efficient and robust molecular catalysts. The focus of this article is given to the immobilisation of these natural or bio-inspired catalysts onto conducting surfaces and the design of electrode and photoelectrode materials for hydrogen evolution/uptake and water oxidation.

"Perfectly aligned silicon microwire arrays show exceptionally high cycling stability with record setting (high) areal capacities of 4.25 mAh cm???2. Those wires have a special, modified length and thickness in order to perform this good. Geometry and sizes are the most important parameters of an anode to obtain batteries with high cycling stability without irreversible losses. The wires are prepared with a unique etching fabrication method, which allows to fabricate wires of very precise sizes. In order to investigate how good randomly oriented silicon wires perform in contrast to the perfect order of the array, the wires are embedded in a paste. This study reveals the fundamental correlation between geometry, mechanics and charge transfer kinetics of silicon electrodes. Using a suitable RC equivalent circuit allows to evaluate data from cyclic voltammetry and simultaneous FFT-Impedance Spectroscopy (FFT-IS), yielding in time-resolved resistances, time constants, and their direct correlation to the phase transformations. The change of the resistances during lithiation and delithiation correlates to kinetics and charge transfer mechanisms. This study demonstrates how the mechanical and physiochemical interactions at the silicon/paste interface inside the paste electrodes lead to void formation around silicon and with it to material loss and capacity fading.",battery
"Potassium-ion batteries attract tremendous attention for large scale application due to the abundance of K resources. Herein, a highly disordered hard carbon derived from a skimmed cotton is investigated for this purpose. The study shows that a simple soaking treatment in hydrochloric acid for the skimmed cotton before its high-temperature carbonization can critically impact the structure and the electrochemical properties of the obtained hard carbon significantly. This hard carbon exhibits a high initial coulombic efficiency (73%) and superior cycling stability and rate capability (253 mAh g???1 and 165 mAh g???1 at 40 mA g???1 and 4000 mA g???1, respectively) due to its unique porous architecture and large surface area. The full cell by coupling the hard carbon with a cathode material, i.e. potassium-rich iron hexacyanoferrate shows an outstanding electrochemical performance. These promising properties highlight the potentials of such a hard carbon in practical applications.",battery
"A high risk of morbidity-mortality caused by a harsh and unpredictable environment is considered to be associated with a fast life history (LH) strategy, commonly linked with criminal behavior. However, offenders are not the only group with a high exposure to extrinsic morbidity-mortality. In the present study, we investigated the LH strategies employed by two groups of Polish men: incarcerated offenders (N??=??84) as well as soldiers and firefighters (N??=??117), whose professions involve an elevated risk of injury and premature death. The subjects were asked to complete the Mini-K (used as a psychosocial LH indicator) and a questionnaire which included a number of biodemographic LH variables. Although biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators should be closely linked with each other, the actual connection between them is unclear. Thus, this study was driven by two aims: comparing LH strategies in two groups of men with a high risk of premature morbidity-mortality and investigating the relationship between the biodemographic and psychosocial LH dimensions. The study showed that incarcerated men employed faster LH strategies than soldiers and firefighters, but only in relation to biodemographic variables (e.g., number of siblings, age of sexual initiation, life expectancy). No intergroup differences emerged regarding psychosocial LH indicators. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed a weak association between biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators. The results strengthen the legitimacy of incorporating biodemographic LH traits into research models and indicate the need for further research on the accuracy of the Mini-K. The possible explanations for the intergroup differences in LH strategies are discussed.",non-battery
"Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) have played a leading role in realizing energy storage devices with high energy and power densities. While both anode and cathode materials are important for high performance ASCs, more research effort has been devoted to developing cathode materials because the energy source of an ASC is mostly attributed to the cathode. However, the development of anode materials is essential in order to achieve high power density as well as stable long-term cycle life of ASCs. In this study, functionalized graphene aerogel (GA) decorated with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles is used as an efficient ASC anode material. The high surface area (328m2 g???1) and low electrical resistivity (50 times lower than one without Pd) of the GA composite grants a high specific capacitance (175.8Fg???1 at 5mVs???1), excllent rate capability (48.3% retention after a 10 fold increase of scan rate), and remarkable reversibility. ASCs assembled from manganese dioxide (cathode) and GA composite (anode) show stable extended cell voltage, fast charge??discharge capability, excellent cycle stability (89.6% retention after 3000 cycles), and high energy and power densities (average of 13.9Whkg???1 and 13.3kWkg???1). These results demonstrate the great potential of the GA composite as an efficient anode material for high performance energy storage devices.",battery
"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used as a hydrogen bond functionalizing agent to modify multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Nanoparticles of Fe3O4 were then formed along the sidewalls of the as-modified CNTs by the chemical coprecipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the presence of CNTs in an alkaline solution. The structure and electrochemical performance of the Fe3O4/CNTs nanocomposite electrodes have been investigated in detail. Electrochemical tests indicated that at the 145th cycle, the CNTs??66.7wt.%Fe3O4 nanocomposite electrode can deliver a high discharge capacity of 656mAhg???1 and stable cyclic retention. The improvement of reversible capacity and cyclic performance of the Fe3O4/CNTs nanocomposite could be attributed to the nanosized Fe3O4 particles and the network of CNTs.",battery

"Nanosized cryptomelane manganese dioxide (MDO) and its SnO2-coated product were prepared through a redox reaction between KMnO4 and Mn(II) acetate. XRD analysis showed the cryptomelane-type structure for both materials. Chemical analysis detected the presence of K in parent and K and Sn in coated oxide. The coating was evidenced by TEM images, which display a thin layer of SnO2 at the surface of nanosized MnO2 particles. Vibrational spectroscopic measurements confirmed the integrity of the MnO2 lattice. The net effect of the SnO2 coating results in better electrochemical performance of the Li//MnO2 cells.",battery
"The state of health (SOH) and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation are important parameters for battery health forecasting as they reflect the health condition of battery and provide a basis for battery replacement. This study proposes a novel on-line synthesis method based on the fusion of partial incremental capacity and artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate SOH and RUL under constant current discharge. Firstly, the advanced filter methods are applied to smooth the initial incremental capacity curves. Then the strong correlation feature values are extracted from the partial incremental curves by using correlation analysis methods. Finally, two ANN models aiming at estimating SOH and RUL are established to estimate the SOH and RUL simultaneously. The training and verification results indicate that the proposed method has highly reliability and accuracy for SOH and RUL estimation.",battery
"Mitrovica, northern Kosovo, is the site of some of the highest Pb concentrations reported in human populations; exemplified by Pb concentrations in scalp hair of up to 130 ??g g???1 and widely-publicized of Pb-related ill-health and mortality amongst internally displaced populations. High human Pb burdens are accompanied by elevated concentrations of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) in soils and house dust within the city, which has a long history of mining and metallurgy. In this study enrichment-levels for PHEs in soils are quantified and compared to environmental quality guidelines and a statistically-derived estimation of background concentration. In addition, Pb isotopes (207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb) are used to characterise the isotopic signatures of potential point sources of Pb and a mixing model employed to quantify the contribution of sources to Pb present in soils, house dust, and the scalp hair of children and young people. Pb isotopic evidence suggests that Pb in surface soils and house-dust is predominantly sourced from historical deposition of Pb-containing aerosols from metal smelting, with lower contributions from wind-blown dispersal of metalliferous waste. Pb present in scalp hair is interpreted as the result of non-occupational exposure and the ingestion and/or inhalation of Pb-enriched surface soil and house dust. This study represents one of the very few instances where this type of geochemical tracing technique has been successfully applied to definitively identify the source of Pb present within biological samples. The results of this study are of particular relevance to environmental management and highlight the human health risk posed by the legacy of now inactive mining and metallurgy in addition to the challenge posed in mitigating the risk posed by diffuse soil pollution.",non-battery
"This paper deals with design of hybrid energy system consisting of wind and photovoltaic with battery storage. A diesel generator is added to ensure continuous power supply and to take care of intermittent nature of wind and photovoltaic. The paper reports results of the technical??economic optimization study of photovoltaic/wind/diesel hybrid with battery storage in Algeria. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the appropriate dimension of stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic/wind/diesel with battery storage that guarantee the energy autonomy of typical remote consumer with lowest cost of energy. A secondary aim is to study the impact of renewable energy potential quality on the system size. The optimum dimensions of the system are defined for six sites in Algeria. In this context, a complete sizing model is developed in Matlab/Simulink V.6.5, able to predict the optimum system configuration. The simulation results indicate that the hybrid system is the best option for all the sites considered in this study. Thus, it provides higher system performance than photovoltaic or wind alone. It s shown that the principal advantage of photovoltaic/wind/diesel hybrid with battery storage are used all together, the reliability of the system is enhanced. The economic analysis has resulted in the calculation of kWh cost of energy for different types of resources and optimized cost of hybrid energy system. It s revealed too that the energy cost depends largely on the renewable energy potential quality. So, our objective for the optimization parameters is not the production cost but the offered service.",battery
"In this work an experimental setup for in-operando temperature measurements across the interfaces anode ?? separator/electrolyte ?? cathode of a lithium-ion battery cell is developed to get a better understanding of the heat generating mechanisms. The results show differences in the heat evolution rates of the anode, the separator and the cathode according to the electrochemical reactions, the state of charge, the overvoltage and the electric current density.

Changes of the ohmic resistance and the entropy of LiCoO2 with the state of charge were reflected by the temperature measurements.",battery
"Patient safety has been regarded as the most important quality policy of hospital management. The medicine dispensing definitely plays an influential role in the Joint Commission International Accreditation Standards. The problem we are going to discuss in this paper is that the function of detecting mistakes does not exist in the Automatic Tablets packaging machine (ATPM) in the hospital pharmacy department when the pharmacists implement the replenishment of cassettes. In this situation, there are higher possibilities of placing the wrong cassettes back to the wrong positions, so that the human errors will lead to a crucial impact on total inpatients undoubtedly. Therefore, this study aims to design the RFID (Radio frequency identification) position based system (PBS) for the ATPM with passive high frequency (HF) model. At first, we placed the HF tags on each cassette and installed the HF readers on the cabinets for each position. Then, the system works on the reading loop to verify ID numbers and positions on each cassette. Next, the system would detect whether the orbit opens or not and controls the readers?? working power consumption for drug storage temperature. Finally, we use the RFID PBS of the ATPM to achieve the goal of avoiding the medication errors at any time for patient safety.",non-battery
"This 2-wave longitudinal study aimed (1) to investigate whether high resting RSA predicted adolescents?? lower externalizing behavior and higher empathic concern, and (2) to address the potential moderating role of resting RSA in the association between parent-adolescent relationship quality and adolescents?? externalizing behavior and empathic concern. In a sample of 379 adolescents (212 boys, 167 girls), resting RSA was assessed during a laboratory session, and adolescents reported on parental support, negative interaction with parents, empathic concern and externalizing behavior during a home visit. We found no support for high resting RSA predicting low externalizing behavior or high empathic concern. However, in line with our hypotheses, we did find several instances of RSA functioning as a moderator, although the interaction patterns varied. First, negative interaction with parents was a negative predictor of externalizing behavior for girls low in resting RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls with high RSA. Second, higher negative interaction with parents predicted lower empathic concern for boys high in resting RSA, whereas the association was reversed for boys with low resting RSA. Third, parental support was a positive predictor of empathic concern for girls high in resting RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls low in resting RSA. The findings suggest that adolescents with different levels of resting RSA respond differentially to relationship quality with parents.

"This study investigated the effects of phonologic treatment for anomia in aphasia. We proposed that if treatment were directed at the level of the phonologic processor, opportunities for naming via a phonological route, as opposed to a strictly whole word route, would be enhanced, thereby improving naming. The participants, ten people with anomia and aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke, received 96h of phoneme based treatment in 12 weeks. To learn if treatment improved naming, a single-subject, repeated probe design with replication was employed. The primary outcome measure was confrontation naming. Secondary outcome measures included phonologic production, nonword repetition and discourse production. Results suggest a positive treatment effect (confrontation naming), improvements in phonologic production and nonword repetition, and generalization to discourse production. When tested 3 months after the completion of treatment the effects appeared to be maintained.",non-battery

"Contact bioassays are important for testing the ecotoxicity of solid materials. However, survival and reproduction tests are often not practical due to their duration which may last for several weeks. Avoidance tests with soil invertebrates may offer an alternative or extension to the classic test batteries due to their short duration (days rather than weeks) and due to a sensitive sub-acute endpoint (behavior). The aims of our study were: (a) to evaluate the effects of three solid industrial wastes (incineration ash, contaminated wood chips and contaminated soil) on three Oligochaeta species (enchytraeids Enchytraeus albidus, Enchytraeus crypticus and earthworm Eisenia fetida) in avoidance tests; (b) to compare the sensitivity among the species and to compare results of avoidance test to reproduction tests; (c) to elucidate if measuring the weight in the earthworm avoidance test could be reasonable additional endpoint. Avoidance mostly increased with the increasing percent of waste in the mixture showing a dose??response curve. E. fetida was the most sensitive species and E. crypticus the least one. An additional endpoint, (changes in weight after two-day exposure) was not found to be more sensitive than avoidance reaction, but it confirmed that earthworms staying in the highest concentrations of the waste mixture were affected showing apparent weight reduction. Our results indicate that avoidance tests with earthworms and enchytraeids are feasible for waste testing.",non-battery
"Single-cell genetic screens can be incredibly powerful, but current high-throughput platforms do not track dynamic processes, and even for non-dynamic properties they struggle to separate mutants of interest from phenotypic outliers of the wild-type population. Here we introduce SIFT, single-cell isolation following time-lapse imaging, to address these limitations. After imaging and tracking individual bacteria for tens of consecutive generations under tightly controlled growth conditions, cells of interest are isolated and propagated for downstream analysis, free of contamination and without genetic or physiological perturbations. This platform can characterize tens of thousands of cell lineages per day, making it possible to accurately screen complex phenotypes without the need for barcoding or genetic modifications. We applied SIFT to identify a set of ultraprecise synthetic gene oscillators, with circuit variants spanning a 30-fold range of average periods. This revealed novel design principles in synthetic biology and demonstrated the power of SIFT to reliably screen diverse dynamic phenotypes.",non-battery

"Introduction Impairment of cerebrovascular function becomes evident after menopause. No study has yet explored relationships between deficits in cerebrovascular function, cognitive performance, and mood in postmenopausal women. Method Cerebrovascular function was assessed in 80 healthy postmenopausal women by monitoring blood flow velocity (BFV) in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler ultrasound at rest, following a hypercapnic challenge, and during performance of a cognitive test battery; the latter assessed domains of memory and executive functions. Various measures of mood (i.e., Profile of Mood States and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) were also assessed. Results Cerebral artery elasticity and BFV responsiveness to cognitive tests (neurovascular coupling) correlated with cognitive performance but not with depressive symptoms or mood states. Mood deficits were related to poor cognitive performance. Conclusion These results highlight the importance of adequate cerebral perfusion for optimized cognitive function in healthy postmenopausal women.

"The development of high-performance and cost-effective electrodes for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction is critical for enabling the use of energy storage devices based on O2??H2O chemistries such as metal??air batteries and unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs). Herein, we report a precious-metal-free and carbon-free O2 electrode synthesized via electrodeposition of manganese oxide (MnOx) on a stainless steel (SS) substrate followed by high-temperature calcination at 480 ??C. The MnOx??SS electrode displays high oxygen reduction and water oxidation activities when tested in an electrochemical cell, comparable to that of a precious-metal based electrode, Pt/C??SS. Accelerated durability testing reveals the excellent stability of the MnOx??SS electrode compared to both the Pt/C??SS electrode and a carbon-based electrode with MnOx and Ni catalysts. This can be rationalized by the carbon-free nature of the MnOx??SS electrode which circumvents carbon corrosion at the high electrochemical potentials during water oxidation and O2 reduction. Integrating the MnOx??SS electrode as the O2 electrode into an anion exchange membrane (AEM) URFC produces round-trip efficiencies of 42??45% at 20 mA cm???2 over 10 cycles, and exhibits significantly enhanced durability compared to the carbon-based analogue.

"The electrochemical polymerization of 2-aminobenzene sulfonic acid, also called ortanilic acid (o-ASA), on a gold electrode precoated with polyaniline (PANI), has been carried out. We proved that the electropolymerization of o-ASA is enhanced on PANI electrodes, resulting in thicker films obtained in aqueous media at room temperature. The electrosynthesized film (P(o-ASA)) was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance. The compensation of P(o-ASA) charge was evaluated using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance combined with cyclic voltammetry, which showed that the electroneutralization process mainly involves cations. Additionally, copolymers of aniline and o-ASA were electrosynthesized, using a metallic electrode modified with PANI also as a working electrode. The degree of sulfanation of copolymers has been modulated with the proportions of monomers in the electrosynthesis solution. The studies reveal a more important participation of cations in fully sulfonated polyaniline than in partially sulfonated polyaniline.",battery

"Given the interest in improving executive functions, the present study examines a promising combination of two training techniques: neurofeedback training (NFT) and working memory training (WMT). NFT targeted increasing the amplitude of individual??s upper Alpha frequency band at the parietal midline scalp location (Pz), and WMT consisted of an established computerized protocol with working memory updating and set-shifting components. Healthy participants (n??=??140) were randomly allocated to five combinations of training, including visual search training used as an active control training for the WMT; all five groups were compared to a sixth silent control group receiving no training. All groups were evaluated before and after training for resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral executive function measures. The participants in the silent control group were unaware of this procedure, and received one of the training protocols only after study has ended. Results demonstrated significant improvement in the practice tasks in all training groups including non-specific influence of NFT on resting-state EEG spectral topography. There was only a near transfer effect (improvement in working memory task) for WMT, which remained significant in the delayed post-test (after 1??month), in comparison to silent control group but not in comparison to active control training group. The NFT??+??WMT combined group showed improved mental rotation ability both in the post-training and in the follow-up evaluations. This improvement, however, did not differ significantly from that in the silent control group. We conclude that the current training protocols, including their combination, have very limited influence on the executive functions that were assessed in this study.

The electrolytes were composed of combinations of four different salts (LiPF6, LiB(C2O4)2, LiI and LiN(SO2CF3)2) and three different solvents (PC, DME, and 1,3-dioxolane). All six electrolytes had conductivities >3mScm???1 at temperatures from ???20 to 40??C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear polarization, both at room temperature and low temperature (???8??C), provided congruent results. The LiI-based electrolyte had the lowest film resistance, while 0.7M LiB(C2O4)2??PC:DME (1:1) had the highest impedance. The presence of 1,3-dioxolane in electrolytes provided lower impedance with LiB(C2O4)2 but higher resistance with LiPF6-based electrolytes. NMR analysis of electrolytes after thermal abuse indicate that LiN(SO2CF3)2-based electrolytes are the most thermally stable. SEM analysis suggests that surface modification and impedance changes are correlated.",battery

"In solid state batteries, lithium dendrites form when the applied current density is higher than a critical value. The critical current density is often reported as 1??2 mA cm???2 at an external pressure of around 10 MPa. In this work, a more advanced mechanical constriction technique is applied on a solid-state battery constructed with Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) as the electrolyte and a lithium metal/graphite composite as the anode, where the graphite layer was applied to prevent (electro-)chemical reactions between Li metal and LGPS, as well as a short-circuit upon the application of pressure. The decomposition pathway of LGPS at the anode interface is modified by this mechanical constriction design, and the growth of lithium dendrites is inhibited, leading to excellent rate and cycling performances. No short-circuit or lithium dendrite formation is observed for batteries cycled at a current density up to 10 mA cm???2.

"Nanostructured ternary TiNi-type alloys, namely Ti0.8M0.2Ni (M??=??Zr, V), TiNi0.8N0.2 (N??=??Cu, Mn) and TiNi1???xMnx (x??=??0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0), were synthesized by mechanical alloying. Depending on the intensity and time of milling alloys with different microstructure were obtained. The as-milled TiNi1???xMnx alloys contain substantial amount of amorphous phase, which crystallizes during annealing. Annealing of the as-milled fine nanocrystalline materials at 500????C results only in slight coarsening of the microstructure, which remains still nanocrystalline. Fully crystalline material (with crystal size larger than 50??nm), consisting of mainly cubic TiNi was obtained by annealing the ball-milled alloys at T???????700????C. Electrochemical hydrogen charge/discharge cycling of the as-milled as well as of annealed alloys were carried out at galvanostatic conditions. It was found that among the nanocrystalline Ti0.8M0.2Ni0.8N0.2 (M??=??Zr, V; N??=??Cu, Mn) alloys TiNi0.8Mn0.2 revealed the highest discharge capacity of 56??mAh??g???1 in the as-milled state and 75??mAh??g???1 after short-time annealing at 500????C. Annealing at higher temperature does not increase the capacity further. The as-milled TiNi1???xMnx alloys with x???????0.4 reveal noticeably higher discharge capacity and better cycle life than the Mn-richer alloys. Based on potentiostatic experiments the diffusion coefficients of hydrogen into TiNi alloys in two different microstructural states (fine and coarser nanocrystalline) as well as in as-milled amorphous/nanocrystalline and nanocrystalline TiNi0.8Mn0.2 were determined. The hydrogen diffusion coefficients of the TiNi alloys are comparable (1.9??2.7??????10???12??cm2??s???1). The diffusion coefficient in the as-milled amorphous/nanocrystalline TiNi0.8Mn0.2 was found to be 3??4 times higher than that of the as-milled nanocrystalline alloy.",battery

"Management of reversible lithium is an advantageous approach to design lithium ion cells that are tolerant to near zero volt (NZV) storage under fixed resistive load towards highly controllable, enhanced user-inactive safety. Presently, the first cycle loss from a high energy density Li-rich HE5050 cathode is used to provide excess reversible lithium when paired with an appropriately capacity matched mesocarbon microbead (MCMB) anode. Cells utilizing 1.2 M LiPF6 3:7 v/v ethylene carbonate:ethyl methyl carbonate electrolyte and a lithium reference were used for 3-electrode testing. After conditioning, a fixed resistive load was applied to 3-electrode cells for 72 or 168-h during which the anode potential and electrode asymptotic potential (EAP) remained less than the copper dissolution potential. After multiple storage cycles (room temperature or 40 ??C), the NZV coulombic efficiency (cell reversibility) exceeded 97% and the discharge capacity retention was >98%. Conventional 2-electrode HE5050/MCMB pouch cells stored at NZV or open circuit for 3 days had nearly identical rate capability (up to 5C) and discharge performance stability (for 500 cycles under a 30% depth of discharge low-earth-orbit regime). Thus, lithium ion cells with appropriately capacity matched HE5050/MCMB electrodes have excellent tolerance to prolonged NZV storage, which can lead to enhanced user-inactive safety.",battery
"A high risk of morbidity-mortality caused by a harsh and unpredictable environment is considered to be associated with a fast life history (LH) strategy, commonly linked with criminal behavior. However, offenders are not the only group with a high exposure to extrinsic morbidity-mortality. In the present study, we investigated the LH strategies employed by two groups of Polish men: incarcerated offenders (N??=??84) as well as soldiers and firefighters (N??=??117), whose professions involve an elevated risk of injury and premature death. The subjects were asked to complete the Mini-K (used as a psychosocial LH indicator) and a questionnaire which included a number of biodemographic LH variables. Although biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators should be closely linked with each other, the actual connection between them is unclear. Thus, this study was driven by two aims: comparing LH strategies in two groups of men with a high risk of premature morbidity-mortality and investigating the relationship between the biodemographic and psychosocial LH dimensions. The study showed that incarcerated men employed faster LH strategies than soldiers and firefighters, but only in relation to biodemographic variables (e.g., number of siblings, age of sexual initiation, life expectancy). No intergroup differences emerged regarding psychosocial LH indicators. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed a weak association between biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators. The results strengthen the legitimacy of incorporating biodemographic LH traits into research models and indicate the need for further research on the accuracy of the Mini-K. The possible explanations for the intergroup differences in LH strategies are discussed.

"The high-frequency induction heating method is an attractive way to synthesize LiFePO4/C within a few minutes. We optimize the heating conditions by a carbon crucible for the homogeneous heating of a precursor pellet from both sides. Compared with our previous samples, the lattice parameters of the LiFePO4/C synthesized in this work (an optimized sample) are improved and are much closer to the values reported by Padhi et al. Although the primary particle size of the optimized sample is slightly larger than that of the previous samples, it is sufficiently small to fully utilize the electrochemical performances of LiFePO4. We reduced the internal charge-transfer resistance of the optimized sample by improving the crystal structure because the Nyquist plots of the electrodes indicate decreased resistance, even though the optimized sample's electronic conductivity is almost the same as that of the previous sample. The electrode based on the optimized sample shows a specific discharge capacity of 168.0 mAh g???1, which achieves 99% theoretical specific capacity of the LiFePO4 phase.

"Extensive studies have already been performed in the past to integrate more than one ??green?? energy source, e.g., solar, wind and hydrogen, for power generation. For actual operation in a realistic environment, such a hybrid process must be fully functional despite random fluctuations in energy supplies and power demands. A common option for accommodating the uncertain disturbances and their cumulative effects is to introduce battery into a properly structured system. However, by using an ad hoc approach, these schemes may be either overdesigned or inoperable. A generic mathematical programming model is thus adopted in the present study to compute a so-called temporal flexibility index for use as a performance measure. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this assessment criterion, a large collection of photovoltaic??fuel cell (PVFC) systems can be configured for a specific application and then compared accordingly so as to identify the best combination of energy supply ratio and battery capacity.

"In this study, synchrotron X-ray nano-computed tomography at Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory has been employed to reconstruct real 3D active particle morphology of a LiMn2O4 (LMO) electrode commonly used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). For the first time, carbon-doped binder domain (CBD) has been included in the electrode structure as a 108nm thick uniform layer using image processing technique. With this unique model, stress generated inside four LMO particles with a uniform layer of CBD has been simulated, demonstrating its strong dependence on local morphology (surface concavity and convexity), and the mechanical properties of CBD such as Young??s modulus. Specifically, high levels of stress have been found in vicinity of particle??s center or near surface concave regions, however, much lower than the material failure limits even after discharging at the rate as high as 5C. On the other hand, the stress inside CBD has reached its mechanical limits when discharged at 5C, suggesting that it can potentially lead to failure by plastic deformation. The findings in this study highlight the importance of modeling LIB active particles with CBD and its appropriate compositional design and development to prevent the loss of electrical connectivity of the active particles from the percolated solid network and power losses due to CBD failure.",battery
"How do members of the public view collaboration among organized interests and what factors contribute to attitudes about working in coalition? Interest groups frequently must decide whether to partner formally in pursuit of a shared objective while minimizing potential losses of revenue, reputation, and issue ownership. Using a nationally representative survey with an embedded experiment, we consider the potential ramifications of group collaboration from the perspective of potential members. Results show that, while a substantial minority views group collaboration negatively, most do not, and experimental exposure to a collaborating group yields positive evaluations and higher prospective contributions. The results reinforce the essentially pluralist public perceptions of interest groups that are supportive of their existing collaborative efforts.

"Nanocrystalline Co3O4 thin-film anodes were deposited on Pt-coated silicon and 304 stainless steel by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited and annealed cobalt oxide thin films showed smooth and crack-free morphologies. Both the as-deposited and annealed films exhibited spinel Co3O4 phase with nanocrystalline structure. High-temperature annealing enhanced the crystallinity of RF-sputtered cobalt oxide films due to rearrangement of cobalt and oxygen atoms. Electrochemical characterization of RF-sputtered films was carried out by cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge tests in the voltage range of 0.3??3.0V. Cyclic voltammetry plots showed that the RF-sputtered Co3O4 thin films were electrochemically active. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) showed that the fresh cobalt oxide films had two peaks of Co3O4. In addition to the binding energy of cobalt oxide, the XPS spectrum of discharged film presented two additional binding energies correspond to Co metal.

"ABSTRACT Two types of sodium-air cells, i.e., nonaqueous and mixed aqueous-nonaqueous (abbreviated as ??aqueous??) cells, have been compared to elucidate factors limiting performances of nonaqueous air cells and how the aqueous electrolyte is effective to reliving these limitation. The two cells have the same configuration consisting of a nanoporous gold (NPG) air electrode and a ceramic separator of fast sodium ion conductor, NASICON. Only the selection of catholyte, either alkyl carbonate-based nonaqueous solution of NaClO4 or aqueous solution of NaOH, is different. All performances are demonstrated to be better for the aqueous one. Lower overpotential of aqueous cell leads to better round-trip efficiency. A large resistance relevant to oxygen reduction reaction in the nonaqueous cell is relieved by changing the catholyte to the aqueous electrolyte, affording higher rate capability and power density. The aqueous electrolyte is also effective to remove the limitation of the discharge capacity defined by the volumetric amount of air electrode, as has been claimed in previous studies on aqueous Na-air cells. Furthermore, the aqueous cell is demonstrated to be robust and less sensitive and to atmosphere. The NPG electrode works reversibly in the half-cell reaction of the aqueous cell, while an electrodeposition of metallic Na on the anode during charging requires an improvement.",battery

"Bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) share similar clinical characteristics that often obscure the diagnostic distinctions between their depressive conditions. Both functional and structural brain abnormalities have been reported in these two disorders. However, the direct link between altered functioning and structure in these two diseases is unknown. To elucidate this relationship, we conducted a multimodal fusion analysis on the functional network connectivity (FNC) and gray matter density from MRI data from 13 BD, 40 MDD, and 33 matched healthy controls (HC). A data-driven fusion method called mCCA+jICA was used to identify the co-altered FNC and gray matter components. Comparing to HC, BD exhibited reduced gray matter density in the parietal and occipital cortices, which correlated with attenuated functional connectivity within sensory and motor networks, as well as hyper-connectivity in regions that are putatively engaged in cognitive control. In addition, lower gray matter density was found in MDD in the amygdala and cerebellum. High accuracy in discriminating across groups was also achieved by trained classification models, implying that features extracted from the fusion analysis hold the potential to ultimately serve as diagnostic biomarkers for mood disorders.",non-battery

"Background It is difficult to improve negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. A previous pilot study has shown that minocycline, a semi-synthetic second-generation tetracycline, is effective in treating for negative and/or cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Objectives The present study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of minocycline for the treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia. Methods Ninety-two patients with early stage schizophrenia treated with risperidone entered this 16-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive minocycline (200mg per day) or the placebo. The primary outcome was evaluated using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Secondary outcomes included the response rate of SANS, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), and cognitive tests. Results Subjects receiving minocycline had greater improvements on SANS total scores and PANSS negative subscale scores (P<0.001) when compared with those receiving the placebo. Rates of treatment response (43.6%) in the minocycline group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group (10.0%) after 16weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference between the seven cognitive domains (P>0.05), except for the attention domain (P=0.044). Conclusions The addition of minocycline to atypical antipsychotic drugs in early schizophrenia had significant efficacy on negative symptoms but had a slight effect on the attention domains of patients with schizophrenia. It may be considered as a new adjunct treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Clinical trials.gov identifier: NCT01493622.",non-battery
"The rapid development of additive manufacturing and advances in shape memory materials have fueled the progress of four-dimensional (4D) printing. With the right external stimulus, the need for human interaction, sensors, and batteries will be eliminated, and by using additive manufacturing, more complex devices and parts can be produced. With the current understanding of shape memory mechanisms and with improved design for additive manufacturing, reversibility in 4D printing has recently been proven to be feasible. Conventional one-way 4D printing requires human interaction in the programming (or shape-setting) phase, but reversible 4D printing, or two-way 4D printing, will fully eliminate the need for human interference, as the programming stage is replaced with another stimulus. This allows reversible 4D printed parts to be fully dependent on external stimuli; parts can also be potentially reused after every recovery, or even used in continuous cycles??an aspect that carries industrial appeal.

"As a popular commercialized cathode material in lithium-ion batteries, the cycle life, practical reversible capacity, and rate capabilities of LiCoO2 (LCO) at high voltage are limited owning to structural irreversibility and surface side reactions. Here, we employ a binary Ba and Ti-based hybrid surface treatment on LiCoO2 (LCO@BT) by facile wet chemical routes. This strategy integrates the advantages of both interface particle doping and surface coating as the layered structure of LCO is stabilized by a binary hybrid surface treatment, and the modified layer promotes the surface Li+ diffusivity and protects the LCO cathode from steady corrosion induced by surface side reaction. On the basis of in-situ NMR characterizations, it is found that after the first electrochemical delithiation/lithiation the phase reversibly changes from O3??I-type in LCO@BT and back to O3??I-type LxCO@BT (0.98 ??? x???1) rather than to a two-phase domain of O3??I and O3-II phase in uncoated LxCO (x???0.98).

"The levels of haplotype diversity within the lineages defined by two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (???13910??C/T and ???22018??G/A) associated with human lactase persistence were assessed with four fast-evolving microsatellite loci in 794 chromosomes from Portugal, Italy, Fulbe from Cameroon, S??o Tom?? and Mozambique. Age estimates based on the intraallelic microsatellite variation indicate that the ???13910*T allele, which is more tightly associated with lactase persistence, originated in Eurasia before the Neolithic and after the emergence of modern humans outside Africa. We detected significant departures from neutrality for the ???13910*T variant in geographically and evolutionary distant populations from southern Europe (Portuguese and Italians) and Africa (Fulbe) by using a neutrality test based on the congruence between the frequency of the allele and the levels of intraallelic variability measured by the number of mutations in adjacent microsatellites. This result supports the role of selection in the evolution of lactase persistence, ruling out possible confounding effects from recombination suppression and population history. Reevaluation of the available evidence on variation of the ???13910 and ???22018 loci indicates that lactase persistence probably originated from different mutations in Europe and most of Africa, even if 13910*T is not the causal allele, suggesting that selective pressure could have promoted the convergent evolution of the trait.

"The charge-compensation mechanism and host stability of a cathode play the central role in determining its reversible capacity. Here, first-principle calculations are presented to study the charge compensation and its effect on the stability of orthosilicates, Li2???x TMSiO4 (TM = Fe, Mn), as the promising high-capacity cathode materials for Li-ion batteries. The charge compensation in Li2???x TMSiO4 upon delithiation is found to be achieved first by a combined reversible TM and oxygen redox process, originating from the dynamic response of their electronic structures to the Li ions (or electrons) removal and the associated charge transfer from the O to Fe ions, and then by the irreversible formation of O vacancy (VO) that destroys the host stability of these materials. Whether the formation of VO in these materials upon delithiation would occur is demonstrated to be essentially determined by the energy level of their highest occupied electronic states and can be understood by the defect charge transition mechanism which provides a quantitative way to estimate to what extent the oxygen redox could be reversibly used in a cathode that being important for the future design of high-capacity cathode materials.",battery

Focused research is currently relating instability sources and degradation mechanisms with the operation conditions, including temperature, illumination, humidity, contaminants and interfacing materials. Although the overall scenario is brighter than years ago, reliable and long-lasting solutions to avoid back-reaction of perovskites to the starting byproducts and indeed to extend cell durability are under spotlight. For the market uptake, moreover, device architectures to be produced via simple and sequential steps, free of contaminants and at low environmental impact, are warmly encouraged to catch the interest of investors. The paper will thus frame strengths and weaknesses of hybrid perovskites for next-generation photovoltaics in view of their extended use and dissemination in daily life.",non-battery
"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease. Given the costs of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG), alternative ambulatory methods for accurate diagnosis are desirable. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a simple device (SleepCheck) to identify patients with sleep apnea. A total of 30 consecutive patients with suspected OSA syndrome referred to the sleep clinic were prospectively evaluated with standard PSG and SleepCheck simultaneously during an in-laboratory, supervised full-night diagnostic study. The PSG apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) was evaluated according to standard criteria, and SleepCheck assessed the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) based on nasal cannula pressure fluctuations. Compared to the full-night PSG, SleepCheck systematically overscored respiratory events (the mean difference between SleepCheck RDI and PSG AHI was 27.4??13.3 events per hour). This overscoring was in part related to normal physiologic decreases in flow during rapid eye movement sleep or after an arousal. However, there was reasonable correlation between AHI and RDI (r=0.805). Receiver operating characteristic curves with threshold values of AHI of 10 and 20/h demonstrated areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.915 and 0.910, respectively. Optimum combinations of sensitivity and specificity for these thresholds were calculated as 86.4/75.0 and 88.9/81.0, respectively. Overall, the SleepCheck substantially overscored apneas and hypopneas in patients with suspected OSA. However, after correction of the bias, the SleepCheck had reasonable accuracy with an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity similar to other ambulatory type 4 devices currently available.",non-battery
"The ability to shift between repetitive and goal-directed actions is a hallmark of cognitive control. Previous studies have reported that adaptive shifts in behavior are accompanied by changes of neural activity in frontal cortex. However, neural and behavioral adaptations can occur at multiple time scales, and their relationship remains poorly defined. Here we developed an adaptive sensorimotor decision-making task for head-fixed mice, requiring them to shift flexibly between multiple auditory??motor mappings. Two-photon calcium imaging of secondary motor cortex (M2) revealed different ensemble activity states for each mapping. When adapting to a conditional mapping, transitions in ensemble activity were abrupt and occurred before the recovery of behavioral performance. By contrast, gradual and delayed transitions accompanied shifts toward repetitive responding. These results demonstrate distinct ensemble signatures associated with the start versus end of sensory-guided behavior and suggest that M2 leads in engaging goal-directed response strategies that require sensorimotor associations.

"LiFePO4 has been a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Different secondary or impurity phases, forming during either synthesis or subsequent redox process under normal operating conditions, can have a significant impact on the performance of the electrode. The exploration of the electronic and chemical structures of impurity phases is crucial to understand such influence. We have embarked on a series of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy studies for the element speciation in various impurity phase materials relevant to LiFePO4 for Li ion batteries. In the present report, soft-X-ray XANES spectra of Li K-edge, P L2,3-edge, O K-edge and Fe L2,3-edge have been obtained for LiFePO4 in crystalline, disordered and amorphous forms and some possible ??impurities??, including LiPO3, Li4P2O7, Li3PO4, Fe3(PO4)2, FePO4, and Fe2O3. The results indicate that each element from different pure reference compounds exhibits unique spectral features in terms of energy position, shape and intensity of the resonances in its XANES. In addition, inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) reveals the surface vs. bulk property of the specimens. Therefore, the spectral data provided here can be used as standards in the future for phase composition analysis.

"In chemical regulation, e.g. the EU Water Framework Directive, REACH, or the Pesticide Directive, standardized ecotoxicological tests are applied to evaluate and rank the hazard of compounds and for deriving environmental quality standards (EQS). Standardized test methods prescribe fixed testing conditions e.g. specific temperature, pH, light intensity etc. However, environmental conditions under which the organisms live are rarely identical to the standard conditions. Thus, the ecotoxicity of compounds found in standard test is not only a function of the compounds inherent physico-chemical properties but is also affected by test conditions. It is therefore important to study the effect of changes in test conditions in order to get reliable input ecotoxicity data for assessing the potential risk posed by a compound. The objective of this study was to investigate the implications of changing test conditions on the toxicity of four sulfonylurea herbicides (SUs). The toxicity of the four SUs towards Lemna gibba was investigated at three pH levels (6, 7.5 and 9), at two temperatures (15 and 24????C) and two light regimes (continuous and 12:12??h light:dark cycle) The EC50 increased twofold to tenfold for the four SUs when pH was increased from 6 to 9. Decreasing the temperature from 24 to 15????C or introducing a dark:light cycle did not cause any trends in changes in toxicity. The results show that test conditions can have an effect on the toxicity and this should be considered when the standard test results are used for derivation of EQS.

Participants were asked to remember the locations of four toys representing one of two categories (animals or chairs) placed in a wooden box. Most participants spontaneously implemented a clustering strategy by removing and/or replacing the toys according to category membership. However, less than half of these strategic participants showed concomitant memory benefits (recall of toy locations). The remainder showed a utilization deficiency. After controlling for age and IQ, participants who performed better on EF tasks were more likely to benefit from having used the clustering strategy. These findings indicate that utilization deficiencies among preschoolers may be partially accounted for by individual differences in EF.",non-battery
"Japan has developed a variety of national strategies and plans related to biofuels which address four main policy objectives, including reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy security, rural development, and realisation of a recycle-based society. This paper reviews these national strategies and plans as well as associated implementing policies, and discusses the extent to which these objectives may be achieved. This paper found that the long-term potential of biofuels to contribute to GHG reduction goals will depend not only on the rates of technological development of the second generation biofuels but also on the development of other advanced vehicles. In the medium term, the potential contribution of biofuels to rural development and realising a recycle-based society could become significant depending on the progress of technology for both second generation biofuel production and the collection and transportation of their feedstocks. The potential contribution of biofuels to Japan??s energy security is constrained by the availability of imports and the potential of domestic production.",battery

The most commonly used cognitive screen, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), though convenient, is not sensitive in these patients.

"The ratio of index- and ring-finger lengths (2D:4D ratio) is thought to be related to prenatal androgen exposure, and in many, though not all, populations, men have a lower average digit ratio than do women. In many studies an inverse relationship has been observed, among both men and women, between 2D:4D ratio and measures of athletic ability. It has been further suggested that, in hunter-gatherer populations, 2D:4D ratio might also be negatively correlated with hunting ability, itself assumed to be contingent on athleticism. This hypothesis has been tested using endurance running performance among runners from a Western, educated, and industrialized population as a proximate measure of hunting ability. However, it has not previously been tested among actual hunter-gatherers using more ecologically valid measures of hunting ability and success. The current study addresses this question among Tanzanian Hadza hunter-gatherers. I employ a novel method of assessing hunting reputation that, unlike previous methods, allows granular distinctions to be made between hunters at all levels of perceived ability. I find no statistically significant relationship between digit ratio and either hunting reputation or two important hunting skills. I confirm that Hadza men have higher mean 2D:4D ratios than men in many Western populations. I discuss the notion that 2D:4D ratio may be the consequence of an allometric scaling relationship between relative and absolute finger lengths. Although it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from these results, the current study provides no support for the theorized relationship between 2D:4D ratio and hunting skill.",non-battery
"Physically-based Li-ion electrochemical cell models have been shown capable of predicting cell performance and degradation, but are computationally expensive for optimization-oriented design applications. Faster empirical models have been developed from experimental data, but are not generalizable to operating conditions outside of the range established by the calibration data. In this paper, a reduced-order capacity-loss model for graphite anodes is derived based upon the salient physical loss mechanisms to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing model fidelity. This model captures the two primary degradation mechanisms that occur in the graphite anode of a typical lithium ion cell: a) capacity loss due to Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) layer growth, and b) capacity loss due to isolation of active material. The model is calibrated and validated for a commercial 2.3-Ah cell with a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) cathode and graphite anode. One data set is used for calibration, another four experimental data sets are used for validation. The model matches experimental capacity degradation results within a 20% error. Moreover, the reported model is 2400?? faster than currently existing more complex physically-based electrochemical models that are only slightly more accurate (in some cases).",battery

It exhibited long-term stability within 20% drops after 72 h-continuous photo-irradiation and subsequent storage for more than 1300 h in dark.

"The aim of this autopsy study was to investigate chest-compression associated injuries to the trunk in out-of-hospital and in-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients treated with automated external chest compression devices (ACCD; all with LUCAS II devices) versus exclusive manual chest compressions (mCC). In this retrospective single-center study, all forensic autopsies between 2011 and 2017 were included. Injuries following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients treated with mCC or ACCD were investigated and statistically compared using a bivariate logistic regression. In the seven-year period with 4433 autopsies, 614 were analyzed following CPR (mCC vs. ACCD: n??=??501 vs. n??=??113). The presence of any type of trunk injury was correlated with longer resuscitation intervals (30??????15 vs. 44??????25 min, p??<??0.05). In comparison with mCC, treatment with ACCD led to more frequent skin emphysema (5 vs 0%, p??=??0.012), pneumothorax (6 vs. 1%, p??=??0.008), lung lesions (19 vs. 4%, p??=??0.008), hemopericardium (3 vs 1%, p??=??0.025) and liver lesions (10 vs. 1%, p??=??0.001), all irrespective of confounding aspects. Higher age and longer CPR durations statistically influenced frequency of sternal and rib fractures (p??<??0.001). The mean number of fractured ribs did not vary significantly between the groups (6??????3 vs. 7??????2, p??=??0.09). In this cohort with unsuccessful CPR, chest compression-related injuries were more frequent following ACCD application than in the mCC group, but with only minutely increased odds ratios. The severity of injuries did not differ between the groups, and no iatrogenic injury was declared by the forensic pathologist as being fatal. In the clinical routine after successful return of spontaneous circulation a computed tomography scan for CPR-associated injuries is recommended as soon as possible.

"Lithium iron phosphate, LiFePO4 (LFP), is considered to be a potential cathode material for lithium-ion batteries but its rate performance is significantly restricted by sluggish kinetics of electrons and lithium ions. A simple solvothermal method has been described in this article to synthesize carbon coated LFP (LFP/C) nanoplates with varying thickness from 20 to 500 nm by using different iron precursors. The influence of solvents on the morphology of the LFP in the solvothermal synthesis is also investigated. A uniform carbon coverage at the surfaces has been achieved by a selective chelating carbonising source, D-gluconic acid lactone. The smallest dimension of the nanoplates has been found to be the b-axis where the Li+ ion diffuses quickly. The overall capacity and rate performance have, in general, been found to increase with the decrease of thickness of the nanoplates. Hierarchical LFP/C with ???30 nm thickness shows the best electrochemical performance of 167 mA h g???1, followed by spindle (<20 nm thickness but aggregated, 121 mA h g???1), plates (200??300 nm thickness, 110 mA h g???1) and diamond shaped LFP/C (300??500 nm thickness, 82 mA h g???1) at a current rate of 17mA g???1 (0.1C rate). The spindle shaped LFP/C shows unexpected electrochemical performance since the nanoplates are heavily agglomerated in the bulk which prevents access for the liquid electrolyte, as well as additive Super P carbon, between neighbouring nanoplates during the fabrication of the composite electrodes. Hence, only the peripheral plates of the spindle are actively involved in the insertion/extraction of Li+, while the core of the spindle shaped LFP/C is almost inactive, resulting in moderate storage behaviour.

"The replacement of traditional conductive carbon additives with single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in lithium metal oxide cathode composites has been shown to enhance thermal stability as well as power capability and electrode energy density. The dispersion of 1wt% high purity laser-produced SWCNTs in a LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 electrode created an improved percolation network over an equivalent composite electrode using 4wt% Super C65 carbon black; evidenced by additive connectivity in SEM images and an order of magnitude increase in electrode electrical conductivity. The cathode with 1wt% SWCNT additives showed comparable active material capacity (185??188mAhg???1), at a low rate, and Coulombic efficiency to the cathode composite with 4wt% Super C65. At increased cycling rates, the cathode with SWCNT additives had higher capacity retention with more than three times the capacity at 10C (16.4mAcm???2). The thermal stability of the electrodes was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry after charging to 4.3V and float charging for 12h. A 40% reduction of the cathode exothermic energy released was measured when using 1wt% SWCNTs as the additive.

"Cr-based cathode materials for Li-ion batteries have attracted significant attentions due to the feature of multiple electron transfer. The origin of the poor electrochemical inactivity of LiCrO2 has not been clarified for decades. Here an irreversible phase transformation from the layered to the rock-salt structure is observed at atomic scale in partially electrochemical delithiated LiCrO2: Cr ions migrate from Cr layers into Li layers in the surface regions. The Cr ions at Li layers in the surface regions could block extraction of lithium from the interior regions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Cr ions in Li layers can stabilize the structure in the Li-poor area, but the diffusion energy barrier of Li ions will be greatly increased. It is proposed accordingly that the surface phase transformation and the blocking of diffusion channel are the main origin for the poor electrochemical reactivity of LiCrO2. Such a surface blocking phenomenon may be a common origin for inactivity of some cathode materials, in which cation mixing become significant after initial delithiation. In addition, Cr ions in LiCrO2 are oxidized only from Cr3+ to Cr4+ during electrochemical delithiation, instead of Cr6+ as usually expected, based on synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) studies.",battery

"Understanding mechanisms of deformation of battery cell components is important in order to improve the mechanical safety of lithium-ion batteries. In this study, micro-scale deformation and failure of fully-discharged battery components including an anode, a cathode, and a separator were investigated at room temperature.

Additionally, interrupted tests were conducted on a polypropylene separator and its deformation at each stage was investigated under SEM. Samples with the same size were loaded to different strains and then fully unloaded. SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were subsequently used to analyze the changes in the microstructure such as crystal orientation and pore size. From these tests, it was found that cathode and anode coatings have distinct deformation mechanisms.

The separator also shows unique stages of deformation such as elongation of fibrils and formation of new pores until reaching final onset of failure.",battery

The concentration change in oxygenated hemoglobin (??[oxy-Hb]) was measured in the bilateral prefrontal areas (Fp1-F7 and Fp2-F8) during the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) letter version and category version, Tower of Hanoi (TOH), Sternberg's (SBT) and Stroop Tasks. In the first group, schizophrenia patients showed poorer task performance on all tasks and less prefrontal cortex activation during all but the Stroop Task compared to healthy subjects. In the second group, schizophrenia patients showed poorer task performance and less prefrontal cortex activation during VFTs and TOH tasks than healthy subjects. We then performed discriminant analysis by a stepwise method using ??[oxy-Hb] and task performance measures as independent variables. The discriminant analysis in the first group included task performance of TOH, VFT letter and VFT category and ??[oxy-Hb] of VFT letter. As a result, 88.3% of the participants were correctly classified as being schizophrenic or healthy subjects in the first analysis. The discriminant function derived from the first group correctly assigned 75% of the subjects in the second group.

"The development of improved State-of-Health (SoH) diagnostic methods is a current research topic for battery-powered applications. For instance, the current rapid development of Electric Vehicles (EV) creates a strong demand for an accurate and reliable on-board SoH indicator during operation. Such an indicator is a key parameter required to optimize battery energy management and to track the degradation of the system performance. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of an electrochemical system is a powerful lab-based diagnostic technique, usually measured using a frequency response analyzer. In this paper, we present an innovative diagnostic technique based on analysis of free voltage and current signals to give a so called ??quasi-electrochemical impedance spectrum?? (QEIS) and demonstrate its application on a Li-ion battery during a real EV duty cycle. It is worth noting that in our technique no additional signal is applied to the cell, since the current flowing into cells during use on-board is directly processed in the data treatment step. Commercial batteries (1.4Ah cylindrical LiFePO4/graphite cell) were selected in this study to validate the diagnostic method in the framework of an applied case study related to an electric school bus demonstrator. In order to study the capability of QEIS measurements as a diagnostic tool for SoH of Li-ion cells, a test procedure including ageing phases has been defined to characterise Li-ion cells before and during ageing. Voltage and current signals were treated by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in order to determine the QEIS spectra of Li-ion cells under study. Then, SoH prediction algorithms have been obtained from a mathematical analysis of the impedance parameters sensitive to SoH.",battery
"This paper uses a semiparametric latent variable transformation model for multiple outcomes to examine the effect of education and maternal education on female multidimensional well-being and proposes a procedure to build a well-being index that is less susceptible to functional form misspecification. We model multidimensional well-being as an unobserved common factor underlying the observed well-being outcomes. The semiparametric methodology allows us to alleviate misspecification bias by combining multiple indicators into a latent construct in an unspecified, data-driven way. Using data from female participants of the 1974??2010 waves of the US General Social Survey, we find that education, intelligence, and maternal education contribute positively to multidimensional well-being. However, the effects of education and maternal education on female multidimensional well-being declined steadily between the mid-1970s and the 1990s, and have not rebounded since.

It has been observed that with increase of the mass of water in the basin increases the optimum number of collector. However the daily and exergy efficiency decreases linearly and nonlinearly with increase of water mass. It has been observed that the maximum yield occurs at N =4 for 50kg of water mass on the basis of exergy efficiency. The thermal model has also been experimentally validated.",battery
"We determined the genotoxicity of 39 chemicals currently in use as food additives. They fell into six categories??dyes, color fixatives and preservatives, preservatives, antioxidants, fungicides, and sweeteners. We tested groups of four male ddY mice once orally with each additive at up to 0.5??LD50 or the limit dose (2000mg/kg) and performed the comet assay on the glandular stomach, colon, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, lung, brain, and bone marrow 3 and 24h after treatment. Of all the additives, dyes were the most genotoxic. Amaranth, Allura Red, New Coccine, Tartrazine, Erythrosine, Phloxine, and Rose Bengal induced dose-related DNA damage in the glandular stomach, colon, and/or urinary bladder. All seven dyes induced DNA damage in the gastrointestinal organs at a low dose (10 or 100mg/kg). Among them, Amaranth, Allura Red, New Coccine, and Tartrazine induced DNA damage in the colon at close to the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). Two antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)), three fungicides (biphenyl, sodium o-phenylphenol, and thiabendazole), and four sweeteners (sodium cyclamate, saccharin, sodium saccharin, and sucralose) also induced DNA damage in gastrointestinal organs. Based on these results, we believe that more extensive assessment of food additives in current use is warranted.",non-battery
"This study proposes an identification model based on subject??action??object (SAO) structure semantic analysis for the potential hotspots of technology demand to address the shortcomings of technology demand mining on the basis of word frequency statistical analysis. The SAO structure is extracted using Python tools to identify the potential hotspots of technology demand, the domain dictionary and professional corpus are introduced, and the clustering of technology demand is realized by applying Word2Vec and HowNet to calculate the semantic similarity among the SAO structures. The layout of the technology demand in the different stages of the technical lifecycle is divided by constructing a technology map. The proposed model is validated as an example of the network technology demand text of the new energy and energy saving fields. Therefore, the hotspots of technology demand are the technology of new energy vehicle motor and its control system, technology of energy efficient and technology of wind power, and the new energy vehicle technology is still in the research and development (R&D) stage. Moreover, solar energy products and production equipment are still in the technical application stage. This study provides an effective method for identifying potential technology demand and based on technology lifecycle to implement the layout and visualization of demand, which will make the decision support for guiding the direction of technology R&D, optimizing the allocation of science and technology resources, and promoting the effective docking of technology supply and demand.",non-battery
"Mg-Al-Pb-Zn alloy is a typical anode material used for high-power seawater activated battery. The chemical composition of a series of Mg-Al-Pb-(Zn) alloys is optimized by a L9 orthogonal array test and the effects of alloying elements, such as aluminium, lead and zinc, on electrochemical properties are investigated through signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) analysis. Microstructure characterization and half-cell test demonstrate that the selected optimal Mg-6%Al-7%Pb-0.5%Zn (wt%) alloy is a good candidate as an anode material for seawater activated battery application due to its high discharge activity, negative discharge potential in large current densities and comparatively higher anode utilization efficiency.

"Herein, we report the synthesis of metallic molybdenum microspheres and hierarchical MoS2 nanostructures by facile template-free solvothermal and hydrothermal approach, respectively. The morphological transition of the Mo microspheres to hierarchical MoS2 nanoflower architectures is observed to be accomplished with change in solvent from ethylenediamine to water. The resultant marigold flower-like MoS2 nanostructures are few layers thick with poor crystallinity while spherical ball-like molybdenum microspheres exhibit better crystalline nature. This is the first report pertaining to the synthesis of Mo microspheres and MoS2 nanoflowers without using any surfactant, template or substrate in hydro/solvothermal regime. It is opined that such nanoarchitectures of MoS2 are useful candidates for energy related applications such as hydrogen evolution reaction, Li ion battery and pseudocapacitors. Inquisitively, metallic Mo can potentially act as catalyst as well as fairly economical Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrate in biosensor applications.

"Copper nanowires enveloped in polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes were obtained by ??second order?? electrodeposition into the pores of anodic porous alumina. The templated synthesis of copper nanowires was performed by both potentiostatic and galvanostatic methods. The morphology of the polyaniline nanotubes, copper nanowires as well as the copper-filled polyaniline nanotubes was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy. The copper nanowires were protected from corrosion and oxidation by the PANI nanotubes. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was performed for the microanalysis of the copper deposition into the polyaniline nanotubes. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to assess the electrochemical properties of the obtained nanostructures as well as the influence of the copper nanowires synthesis method on the properties of filled polyaniline nanotubes.

"This work describes the study of the electrochemical properties of fullerene polymer composites, C60-Pd, and different carbon nanostructures, such as single walled carbon nanotubes, multi walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanoonions, as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors. The carbon nanostructures were deposited onto a bare gold disc electrode by a vapor deposition process. In the next step, the fullerene was electrochemically polymerized under cyclic voltammetric conditions. The obtained composites are electrochemically active at negative potentials due to the reduction of the fullerene moieties. The voltammetric response corresponding to this electrochemical process depends on the type of nanostructure and the amount of material deposited at the electrode surface. Such systems exhibit promising electrochemical properties. The highest capacitance of about 1000Fg???1, with respect to mass of polymer, was obtained for the SWCNTs/C60-Pd composite. This value is about four times higher compared to the capacitance of the polymer deposited on a bare gold electrode surface. Lower values of the specific capacitance were obtained for composites containing other MWCNTs and ox-CNOs. For the C60-Pd/ox-CNOs composites the highest values of the specific capacitance were found to be about 280Fg???1.",battery
"Spinel lithium manganese oxides with a nominal composition of LiM0.05Mn1.95O4 (M=Mn, Li, Al, Co, Ni, or B) are prepared and their degradation mechanisms encountered in lithium secondary cells are investigated. Among the degradation mechanisms proposed in previous reports, those arising either from cation mixing or from the formation of oxygen-deficient spinels are negligible in these materials, but a certain amount of spinel dissolution is observed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the spinel lattice experiences an appreciable change in volume during charge??discharge cycling. The extent of this change depends on the nature of dopant. Compared to the undoped spinel, the lattice expansion/contraction according to Li+ insertion/removal is more significant in the B-doped spinel, but it is smaller in the case of Ni-, Co-, Al-, or Li-doped spinels. Spinels experiencing a smaller volume change maintain their structural integrity, even after prolonged cell cycling, such that there is a better capacity retention. In the B-doped spinel, however, the spinel lattice is largely collapsed and new phases are formed after cell cycling. This results in poor cycleability. It is proposed that the structural breakdown due to the repeated change in lattice volume is the most important failure mode in these materials. Spinel dissolution plays a second major role.",battery
"Glucose oxidase (GOx) from Penicillium funiculosum 46.1 was purified using step-by-step ultrafiltration and it was characterized by spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods.

Thermal, mechanical, swelling, liquid electrolyte retention and electrochemical properties, as well as microstructures of the prepared polymer electrolytes, were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the addition of DH-4-CN could obviously improve the conductivity of PVDF-HFP based electrolyte. The maximum ionic conductivity of 4.36mScm???1 at 20??C can be obtained for PVDF-HFP/DH-4-CN 14:1 in the presence of 1M LiPF6 in EC and DMC (1:1, w/w).

"The pumping loss of redox flow batteries increases dramatically when scaling up to large-area cells, and becomes a key limiting factor for engineering high-performance cell stacks. This work proposes a hierarchical interdigitated flow field design that has independently regulated distribution/collection channels to lower pumping loss and enhance mass transport: a small quantity of primary branch channels with larger section area is engineered to transport the electrolyte across the length of the entire electrode with a relatively low pressure drop, while a large number of secondary branch channels with smaller section area serve to inject the electrolyte into the adjacent porous electrode with a relatively high velocity to ensure good mass transport. The analytical and experimental methods are combined to understand the mass transport phenomena in the presented flow field. It is shown that the hierarchical interdigitated flow field can significantly reduce the pumping loss by 65.9% and increase the pump-based voltage efficiency from 73.8% to 79.1% at 240 mA cm???2 and 3.0 mL min???1 cm???2 compared with the conventional interdigitated flow field, which demonstrates that the hierarchical interdigitated flow field presents a promising solution for scaling up the high-performance redox flow batteries.",battery
"Solutions of novel fluorinated lithium dodecaborate (Li2B12F x H12???x ) salts have been evaluated as electrolytes in nonaqueous asymmetric supercapacitors with Li4Ti5O12 as negative electrode, and activated carbon (AC) as positive electrode.

The specific energy, rate capability, and cycling performances of nonaqueous asymmetric cells based on these new electrolyte salts were studied. Cells assembled using the new fluoroborate salts show excellent reversibility, coulombic efficiency, rate capability and improved cyclability when compared with the standard electrolyte.

"TNF promotes a regulated form of necrosis, called necroptosis, upon inhibition of caspase activity in cells expressing RIPK3. Because necrosis is generally more pro-inflammatory than apoptosis, it is widely presumed that TNF-induced necroptosis may be detrimental in vivo due to excessive inflammation. However, because TNF is intrinsically highly pro-inflammatory, due to its ability to trigger the production of multiple cytokines and chemokines, rapid cell death via necroptosis may blunt rather than enhance TNF-induced inflammation. Here we show that TNF-induced necroptosis potently suppressed the production of multiple TNF-induced pro-inflammatory factors due to RIPK3-dependent cell death. Similarly, necroptosis also suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Consistent with these observations, supernatants from TNF-stimulated cells were more pro-inflammatory than those from TNF-induced necroptotic cells in vivo. Thus necroptosis attenuates TNF- and LPS-driven inflammation, which may benefit intracellular pathogens that evoke this mode of cell death by suppressing host immune responses.",non-battery

The association between higher activity and more detailed memories suggests that A??-related hyperactivation is compensatory.

"LiFePO4 has been extensively studied in recent years because of superior thermal stability for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, LiFePO4 still undergo iron dissolution at high temperature or moisture-contaminated electrolyte, and the detailed mechanism is still not clear. Few efforts have been devoted to the correlations between surface chemistry and aging mechanisms. Here, we present a direct visual observation of surface corrosion process at olivine LiFePO4, and found the direct relationship between impurity phases and LiFePO4 corrosion. By using the LiFePO4 ingot sample with a flat surface as model materials, two types of impurity phase (iron-rich and phosphorus-rich) can be clearly observed and their influences on LiFePO4 corrosion were investigated in detail by SEM, Tof-SIMS, and electrochemical Tafel analysis. Similar to the electrochemical cell mechanism in a common metal corrosion process, an oxidation??reduction mechanism was suggested at the impurity phases-relevant corrosion behavior. Iron-rich impurity phases are seriously corroded due to the lower corrosion potentials, which inhibit the corrosion of the adjacent LiFePO4 bulk. On the contrary, phosphorus-rich impurity phase is stable due to higher corrosion potentials, which evokes the serious corrosion occurring at the adjacent LiFePO4 bulk. These findings provide the deep understanding the underlying mechanism in the LiFePO4 aging.",battery
"Several methods have been investigated to enhance the cycle life of amorphous MgNi used as the negative electrode for Ni-MH batteries. The first approach involves modifying its surface composition in different ways, including the electroless deposition of a chromate conversion coating, the addition of chromate salt or NaF into the electrolyte and the mechanical coating of the particles with various compounds (e.g. TiO2). Another approach consists of developing (MgNi+AB5) composite materials. However, the cycle life of these modified MgNi electrodes remains unsatisfactory. On the other hand, the modification of the bulk composition of the MgNi alloy with elements such as Ti and Al appears to be more effective. For instance, a Mg0.9Ti0.1NiAl0.05 electrode retains 67% of its initial discharge capacity (404mAhg???1) after 15 cycles compared to 29% for MgNi. The charging conditions also have a great influence on the electrode cycle life as demonstrated by the existence of a charge input threshold below which minor capacity decay occurs.

Modern automotive electronic control systems use microcontrollers based on microprocessors to implement almost all control functions. Each of these subsystems requires one or more sensors and actuators in order to operate. Fundamentally, an electronic control system uses measurements of the plant variable being regulated for feedback control. Temperature is an important parameter throughout the automotive system.

The waste composition for Istanbul has changed markedly from 1981 to 1996 with large decreases in waste density, much of which is related to decreased amounts of ash collected in winter. In recent years, the Istanbul region has implemented a new solid waste management system with transfer stations, sanitary landfills, and methane recovery, which has led to major improvements. In the Black Sea region of Turkey, most of the municipal and industrial solid wastes, mixed with hospital and hazardous wastes, are dumped on the nearest lowlands and river valleys or into the sea. The impact of riverside and seashore dumping of solid wastes adds significantly to problems arising from sewage and industry on the Black Sea coast. Appropriate integrated solid waste management systems are needed here as well; however, they have been more difficult to implement than in Istanbul because of more difficult topography, weaker administrative structures, and the lower incomes of the inhabitants.",non-battery

Spatial working memory performance was impaired in the alcohol group after 120 drinking sessions (6 mo) in a manner that depended on retention interval. The chronic alcohol animals were also impaired in retaining a visual discrimination over 24 hrs when assessed 6??8 weeks after cessation of alcohol drinking. Finally, the presentation of distractors in the response time task impaired the response time and accuracy of the chronic alcohol group more than controls after 6 months of alcohol cessation. Chronic alcohol consumption over as little as 6 months produces cognitive deficits, with some domains still affected after acute (6??8 wks) and lasting (6 mo) discontinuation from drinking. Animals were matched on alcohol preference and behavioral performance prior to exposure, thus providing strong evidence for the causal role of chronic alcohol in these deficits.",non-battery
"Esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, more commonly known as acrylates and methacrylates, respectively, are key raw materials in the coatings and printing industry, with several of its chemical class used in food packaging. The results of over 200 short-term in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies available in the open literature have been evaluated. Despite differences in acrylate or methacrylate functionality or in the number of functional groups, a consistent pattern of test response was seen in a typical regulatory battery of mutagenicity tests. No evidence of point mutations was observed when acrylic acid or over 60 acrylates and methacrylates were investigated in Salmonella bacterial tests or in hprt mutation tests mammalian cells, and no evidence of a mutagenic effect was seen when tested in whole animal clastogenicity and/or aneuploidy (chromosomal aberration/micronucleus) studies. Consistent with the in vivo testing results, acrylic acid exhibited no evidence of carcinogenicity in chronic rodent cancer bioassays. In contrast, acrylic acid and the entire acrylate and methacrylate chemical class produced a consistently positive response when tested in the mouse lymphoma assay and/or other in vitro mammalian cell assays designed to detect clastogenicity. The biological relevance of this in vitro response is questioned based on the non-concordance of in vitro results with those of in vivo studies addressing the same mutagenic endpoint (clastogenicity). Thus, in short-term mutagenicity tests, the acrylates and methacrylates behave as a single chemical category, and genotoxicity behavior of a similar chemical can be predicted with confidence by inclusion within this chemical class, thus avoiding unnecessary testing.",non-battery
"The in situ strategy of cathode protection opportunistically uses PF6 ??? anions in electrolyte as chemical reagents to convert inactive precursor molecules to active electrolyte additives. With our approach, a bifunctional x(SiMe3)2 precursor replaces fluoride in the hexafluorophosphate, forming either a bidentate monoanion P(x)F4 ??? or a linear x(PF5 ???)2 dianion, depending on the bridge x (e.g., oxalato, malonato, succinato, and catecholato). While the efficiency of these species as cathode protective agents has been demonstrated, the mechanism for their beneficial action remains unknown. In this study, several molecular precursors have been synthesized, and the topology and energetics of secondary anions were correlated with their cycling performance. Regardless of their structural motif, all such additives demonstrated improved electrochemical performance by reducing initial cathode impedance and lowering the rate of capacity fade compared to the baseline electrolyte. However, bidentate monoanions with a malonato bridge showed significant advantage over other molecular designs for mitigating the impedance rise, suggesting that structural strain in the anion is important for easing surface modification of the cathode.",battery
"Road transportation, as an important requirement of modern society, is presently hindered by restrictions in emission legislations as well as the availability of petroleum fuels, and as a consequence, the fuel cost. For nearly 270 years, we burned our fossil cache and have come to within a generation of exhausting the liquid part of it. Besides, to reduce the greenhouse gases, and to obey the environmental laws of most countries, it would be necessary to replace a significant number of the petroleum-fueled internal-combustion-engine vehicles (ICEVs) with electric cars in the near future. In this article, we briefly describe the merits and demerits of various proposed electrochemical systems for electric cars, namely the storage batteries, fuel cells and electrochemical supercapacitors, and determine the power and energy requirements of a modern car. We conclude that a viable electric car could be operated with a 50 kW polymer-electrolyte fuel cell stack to provide power for cruising and climbing, coupled in parallel with a 30 kW supercapacitor and/or battery bank to deliver additional short-term burst-power during acceleration.",battery
"Anode material Li4Ti5O12 for lithium-ion batteries has been prepared by a novel sol??gel method with oxalic acid as a chelating agent and Li2CO3 and tetrabutyl titanate [Ti(OC4H9)4] as starting materials. Various initial conditions were studied in order to find the optimal conditions for the synthesis of Li4Ti5O12. Oxalic acid used in this method functioned as a fuel, decomposed the metal complexes at low temperature and yielded the free impurity Li4Ti5O12 compounds. Thermal analyses (TG??DTA) and XRD data show that powders grown with a spinel structure (Fd3m space group) have been obtained at 800??C for 16h. SEM analyses indicated that the prepared Li4Ti5O12 powders had a uniform cubic morphology with average particle size of 200nm. The influence of synthesis conditions on the electrochemical properties was investigated and discussed. The discharge capacity of Li4Ti5O12 synthesized with an oxalic acid to titanium ratio R =1.0 was 171mAhg???1 in the first cycle and 150mAhg???1 after 35 cycles under an optimal synthesis condition at 800??C for 20h. The very flat discharge and charge curves indicated that the electrochemical reaction based on Ti4+/Ti3+redox couple was a typical two-phase reaction.",battery
"A hybrid of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) anchored with SnS nanosheets is synthesized through a simple solvothermal method for the first time. Interestingly, SnS can be controllably deposited onto the MWCNTs backbone in the shape of nanosheets or nanoparticles to form two types of SnS/MWCNTs hybrids, SnS NSs/MWCNTs and SnS NPs/MWCNTs. When evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the hybrids exhibit higher lithium storage capacities and better cycling performance compared to pure SnS. It is found that the SnS NSs/MWCNTs hybrid exhibits a large reversible capacity of 620mAhg???1 at a current of 100mAg???1 as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, which is better than SnS NPs/MWCNTs. The improved performance may be attributed to the ultrathin nanosheet subunits possess short distance for Li+ ions diffusion and large electrode-electrolyte contact area for high Li+ ions flux across the interface. It is believed that the structural design of electrodes demonstrated in this work will have important implications on the fabrication of high-performance electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.",battery
"This study describes the assembly of a rechargeable seawater battery using hard carbon as the anode, seawater as the cathode, and a fast Na ion-conducting ceramic as the solid electrolyte. Two different Na ion-conducting ceramics, ????-Al2O3 and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON), are used as the solid electrolytes in this study. The discharge capacity of the seawater battery with the NASICON solid electrolyte is 120mAhg???1 after the first cycle and over 91% coulombic efficiency after twenty cycles. However, under the same experimental conditions, the discharge capacity of the seawater battery with a ??""-Al2O3 electrolyte significantly drops to 10mAhg???1 after one cycle. It is observed that the stability of NASICON in seawater is superior to that of ??""-Al2O3 and impedance results of NASICON are not changed significantly compared to that of ??""-Al2O3 after cycling tests. The stability of Na ion-conducting ceramics in seawater and their effects on the electrochemical performance of seawater batteries are presented and discussed.",battery

"This study presents a brief review of Hybrid Power Sources (HPSs) for space applications to compare the results obtained for a HPS under unknown load containing pulses. The reliable technologies for energy sources and Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that can operate safety in extreme environments (very low temperature, intense radiation environments etc.) and under dynamic load demand (including load pulses) are compared based on the targets for power and energy density, efficiency, and lifetime. The pros and cons for HPS architectures and ESS topologies proposed in the literature are discussed in frame of optimization of the whole system. Two new optimization strategies were proposed to optimally operate the Fuel Cell (FC) system based on two control loops implemented based on the global optimization control of the boost DC-DC converter and the load-following control of the fuel flow rate or of the air flow rate. The comparative study performed (under constant load, dynamic load, and variable PV power) points out the advantages of one of the proposed optimization strategy in all performance indicators. For example, the gaps compared with the reference strategy are of 1.88%, 13.61 W/lpm, and 293 lpm for FC system efficiency, fuel consumption efficiency, and fuel economy, if the maximum load is considered. Also, different control methods are proposed at the ESS side to mitigate the load pulses (protecting the FC system) and regulate the DC voltage. The results obtained in this paper are discussed related to other ESS hybridizations and control solutions reported in the literature.",battery
"The enhancement of the surface alignment by magnetic field had a great theoretical and practical significance in the improvement of electrochemical capacitor. In the present study, the NiO nanowires were synthesized by liquid-phase reduction method, and the electrode was prepared within external magnetic field. The effects of magnetic field on the electrode surface and the electrochemical behavior were investigated. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope studies showed that the applied magnetic field results in an orderly surface structure of the electrode, which induced an effective transfer path for the electrons and ions. Meanwhile, the orderly electrode surface improved the electrochemical capacitance, as well as decreased the internal resistance. It was found on the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements that the electrode prepared with the magnetic field displays an increased capacitance (506??F??g???1), high power density (135.8??W??kg???1) and energy density (17.6??Wh??kg???1), and improved cycle stability compared to the electrode without magnetic field.

"The energy density of lithium-ion batteries can be raised by increasing the redox potential of the positive electrode. This can be done in principle by substituting oxygen in commonly used lithium transition metal oxides with the more electronegative fluorine. To synthesize the quaternary lithium transition metal fluoride LiMgFeF6 with triturile structure a sol??gel process without toxic chemicals was used. The as-synthesized LiMgFeF6 was ball milled with carbon and binder to characterize the electrochemical properties of the LiMgFeF6/carbon/binder nanocomposite against lithium metal. After 20 cycles of galvanostatic cycling a reversible specific capacity of 107 mAh g???1, which is 80% of the theoretical capacity (1 eq. Li = 133 mAh g???1), was retained. In a rate performance test up to a discharge rate of 1C the LiMgFeF6/carbon/binder nanocomposite provided a specific capacity of 64 mAh g???1.

"The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of crime and discipline on graduation rates in higher education. Using national data on more than 1250 public and private non-profit institutions that were drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the results reveal that more violence on and around campus is associated with lower 4-year graduation rates, whereas higher rates of disciplinary actions regarding alcohol, drugs, and weapons are associated with higher graduation rates. Furthermore, the findings suggest that utilizing the student conduct system rather than the criminal justice system to address minor offenses is more likely to lead to student success. This study contributes to the growing literature on college effectiveness and the influence of institutional structures and organizational policies on student achievement. The results of this study suggest that violent crime, institutional conduct systems, and campus police departments warrant further investigation.

"Since dependency on fossil fuels and nuclear energy has become a main global concern, the South Korean government has made significant efforts for the diffusion and vitalization of renewable energy generation facilities. One of the notable efforts for renewable energy is the government's and research institutes?? provision of natural resource maps. Although these maps are useful for the diffusion of renewable energy generation systems, the economic feasibility of these systems can be affected by various factors (e.g., cost of the components in the systems or the characteristics of national electricity demand). Therefore, the current study investigates the economic feasibility of renewable energy generation systems in 17 selected cities in South Korea using information on the currently considered components and the hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources (HOMER) software.

The increasing number of critical patients who, experiencing respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome, need respiratory support, has been leading countries to race against time in arranging new Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and in finding affordable and practical solutions to manage patients in each stage of the disease. The simultaneous worldwide emergency caused serious problems for mechanical ventilators supply. This chaotic scenario generated, indeed, a frenetic race to buy life-saving ventilators. However, the variety of mechanical ventilators designs, together with the limitations in time and resources, make the decision-making processes on ventilators procurement crucial and not counterbalanced by the evaluation of devices quality.

"Introduction: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is strongly associated with synucleinopathy and is caused by REM sleep without atonia (RSWA), the loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep. We aimed to determine whether RSWA severity was associated with cognitive functioning in RBD. Materials and methods: Both idiopathic (iRBD) and symptomatic RBD (sRBD) patients completed two cognitive batteries: CNS Vitals Signs (CNS-VS) and Useful Field of View (UFOV). All subjects underwent PSG and their muscle (SM: submentalis; AT: anterior tibialis) tone during REM sleep was visually and automatically scored. Group differences between sRBD and iRBD were then compared, and regression models fit to determine the relationship of RSWA and dependent cognitive measures. Results: Twenty iRBD and 10 sRBD participated. Demographics were similar between groups. Deficits on cognitive testing were observed on CNS-VS in processing speed (p = 0.014) and psychomotor speed (sRDB < iRBD, p = 0.019) and on Total UFOV and subtests 2 and 3 (sRBD > iRBD, all p < 0.002). sRBD patients had greater combined phasic and tonic RSWA in SM (p = 0.026) and longer mean phasic burst duration (p = 0.03). Regression analyses demonstrated that SM RSWA independently predicted overall CNS-VS Neurocognitive Index (NCI) (F = 4.5, p = 0.006), adjusting for age, gender, depressive symptoms (Zung score), and sleep disturbances (PSQI), and this relationship also remained significant in the iRBD group after excluding sRBD patients (F = 3.5, p = 0.03). Conclusion: SWA is predictive of lower overall cognitive performance in patients with RBD.

"Herein, we present a new strategy for the mass production of high-quality reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with a surface area of 354 m2 g???1 using high pressure hydrogen as a reducing agent under hydrothermal conditions. The high pressure used is solely generated from the packing of the gas cylinder itself and a pressure meter could simply fulfil the role of monitoring pressure. The reduction process is green without chemical wastes produced. Comparing to other reported methods, the significant advancements of our strategy lie not only in the high-quality RGO with high C/O ratio, conductivity and surface area, but also in the most environment-friendliness and cost-effectiveness, which make the large scale fabrication feasible. Moreover, clean noble metal nanocrystals such as Pt could be easily in situ deposited onto the surface of RGO nanosheets when noble metal salts are introduced into the system. In particular, the prepared RGO and Pt/RGO show exceptional electrochemical performances in supercapacitors and lithium oxygen batteries because of their clean electrochemical surface, good conductivity and large surface area.

"Objectives The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the available evidence from the published scientific literature on dementia care and service provision in rural and remote settings from the perspective of formal/paid caregiving, in order to assess the current state of knowledge, identify policy and practice implications, and make recommendations for future research. Methods A systematic review of the literature indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge, PsychInfo, Medline, Healthstar, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Sociological Abstracts was conducted. Data were extracted from papers meeting inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed papers that focused on dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD), examined care or service provision in relation to persons with AD or dementia, and relevant to rural or remote care or services. Results The search identified 872 articles for review, reduced to 72 after removing duplicates and articles not meeting criteria. Of the 72 remaining, 46 are included in this current review focusing on formal or paid care. A future review will focus on the 26 studies on informal/unpaid care. Six themes that correspond to the current state of knowledge in rural dementia care in the 46 included studies were: diagnostic processes, service provision, service models and programs, staff education and support needs, use of technology, and long-term care. Conclusions Despite the growing body of evidence over the 20 years covered by this review, much of the research is descriptive and/or based on small sample sizes, and distributed across the care continuum. Hence the body of evidence on which to base policy and program decisions remains limited.

"Nowadays nickel-rich LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 (0.5 < x < 1) cathode materials attract great research interests due to their high specific capacity in lithium ion batteries. However, poor cycling performance and serious safety concerns trade off their benefits. Here, we present an effective etching-induced coating strategy for surface modification of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode materials by LiAlO2. Hydrolysis of AlCl3 creates H+ to etch the hydroxide precursor of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and to induce oriented deposition of Al(OH)3 layer on surface of the hydroxide precursor, which is transformed into uniform ??-LiAlO2 coating on the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 particles after the subsequent lithium impregnating and annealing.

"Summary The purpose of this study was to examine the physiological correlates of the Yo??Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo??Yo IR1) in basketball players. Twenty-two male basketball players (means??S.D., body mass 72.4??11.4kg, height 181.7??6.9cm, age 16.8??2.0 years) were tested for maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), ventilatory threshold (VT) and running economy (RE) on a motorized treadmill. Lower limb explosive strength and anaerobic-capacity was assessed using vertical jumps (CMJ), 15m shuttle running sprint (15mSR) and line drill (LD), respectively. The same test battery was replicated after an experimental basketball game in order to assess selective effect of fatigue on physical performance. Pre to post-game CMJ (40.3??5.7 versus 39.9??5.9cm) and 15mSR (5.80??0.25 versus 5.77??0.22s) performances were not significantly different (p >0.05). LD performance decreased significantly post-game (from 26.7??1.3 to 27.7??2.7s, p <0.001). Yo??Yo IR1 performances (m) were significantly related to VO2max (r =0.77, p =0.0001), speed at VO2max (r =0.71, p =0.0001) and %VO2max at VT (r =???0.60, p =0.04).

"The effect of bismuth (Bi) for both VO2 +/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples in vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) has been investigated by directly introducing Bi on the surface of carbon felt (CF). The results show that Bi has no catalytic effect for VO2 +/VO2+ redox couple. During the first charge process, Bi is oxidized to Bi3+ (never return back to Bi metal in the subsequent cycles) due to the low standard redox potential of 0.308V (vs. SHE) for Bi3+/Bi redox couple compared with VO2 +/VO2+ redox couple and Bi3+ exhibit no (or neglectable) electro-catalytic activity. Additionally, the relationship between Bi loading and electrochemical activity for V3+/V2+ redox couple was studied in detail. 2wt% Bi-modified carbon felt (2%-BiCF) exhibits the highest electrochemical activity. Using it as negative electrode, a high energy efficiency (EE) of 79.0% can be achieved at a high current density of 160mA/cm2, which is 5.5% higher than the pristine one. Moreover, the electrolyte utilization ratio is also increased by more than 30%.

"Much work has focused on the effects of metal-contaminated sediment on benthic community structure, but effects on ecosystem functions have received far less attention. Decomposition has been widely used as an integrating metric of ecosystem function in lotic systems, but not for lentic ones. We assessed the relationship between low-level sediment lead (Pb) contamination and leaf-litter decomposition in a lentic system. We measured 30-day weight loss in 30 litter-bags that were deployed along a Pb-contamination gradient in a cypress-forested lake. At each deployment site we also quantified macrobenthos abundance, dissolved oxygen, water depth, sediment organic content, sediment silt/clay content, and both total sediment and porewater concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Principal components (PC) analysis revealed a negative relationship between Pb concentration and benthic macroinvertebrate abundance, and this covariation dominated the first PC axis (PC1). Subsequent correlation analyses revealed a negative relationship between PC1 and percent leaf-litter loss.

"One of the most critical factors for lifetime and operability of ad-hoc and sensor networks is the limited amount of available energy. To this respect, minimizing the interference in the network (i.e., the overlapping of signals at network nodes) has certainly a positive effect, because it induces a reduction of the number of conflicting transmissions, and then results in an overall saving of energy consumption. Along this direction, in this paper we study the computational hardness of several interference minimization problems which arise while supporting some classic network communication patterns such as broadcasting (one-to-all), gossiping (all-to-all), and symmetric gossiping (symmetric all-to-all). In particular, concerning the non-approximability results, we prove that for any of the above communication patterns, the prominent problem of minimizing the maximum interference experienced by any node in the network is hard to approximate within better than a logarithmic factor, unless NP admits slightly superpolynomial time algorithms. On a positive side, we show that any approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the total transmission power assigned to the nodes in order to guarantee any of the above communication patterns, can be transformed, by maintaining the same performance ratio, into an approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the total interference experienced by all the nodes in the network.",non-battery

To cross-check the results, an established ??powder probe?? method is used to confirm the relative resistivity changes caused by calendering. Slight calendering of LiNiMnCoO2 cathodes leads to an increase in electrode resistivity as conductive pathways are broken by the applied shear forces. However, increasing the cathode density to 2.95g/cm3 decreases resistivity by one third compared to uncalendered electrodes by re-establishing and shortening electrical pathways. Furthermore, a relative resistivity of anodes produced with a high energy powder mixing step is measured and shows that applying too much stress to the carbon black leads to a loss in long range conductivity, resulting in electrodes with an increased resistivity of up to 50%.",battery
"Flexible Li-ion batteries have shown great promise in powering wearable electronic devices due to their high energy/power densities and long cycling time. However, coordinating the promising electrochemical performance and flexibility for different applications is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a highly conductive graphene-modified mesoporous anatase TiO2 (M-TiO2-GS) hierarchical film electrode for flexible Li-ion battery anode via a two-step vacuum filtration method. In such a hierarchical film electrode, the down-layer composed of bare graphene component provides ideal mechanical flexibility and electronic conductivity, and the hybrid top-layer composed of both graphene and active M-TiO2 guarantees effective Li+ and electrons transport pathways and acts as the active layer for energy storage. The designed M-TiO2-GS film electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 205 and 76 mAh g???1 at rates of 0.5C and 20C, respectively, and high capacity retention of ???70.5% after 3500 cycles at 5C. When packed in flexible cells, the M-TiO2-GS electrode can also maintain a highly reversible capacity and outstanding cycling stability in both flating and benting conditions. This work may provide a promising anode candidate for the next-generation flexible LIBs and the developed two-step filtration method can be readily applied to other flexible electrodes.",battery
"Municipal waste landfills contain numerous sources of mercury which could be emitted to the atmosphere. Their generation of methane by anaerobic bacteria suggests that landfills may act as bioreactors for methylated mercury compounds. Since our previous study at a single Florida landfill, gaseous inorganic and methylated mercury species have now been identified and quantified in landfill gas at nine additional municipal landfills in several regions of the US. Total gaseous mercury occurs at concentrations in the ??gm???3 range, while methylated compounds occur at concentrations in the ngm???3 range at all but one of the landfill sites. Dimethylmercury is the predominant methylated species, at concentrations up to 100ngm???3, while monomethyl mercury was generally lower. Limited measurements near sites where waste is exposed for processing (e.g. working face, transfer areas) suggest that dimethylmercury is released during these activities as well. Although increasing amounts of landfill gas generated in the US are flared (which should thermally decompose the organic mercury to inorganic mercury), unflared landfill gas is a potentially important anthropogenic source of methylated mercury emissions to the atmosphere.",non-battery
"With the limited but ongoing usage of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the health effects of both PFOS and its alternatives are far from being understood. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was evaluated in rats after exposure to PFOS and its alternatives, aiming to provide some evidence about their potential to affect cognitive ability. Different dosages of PFOS and alternative chemicals, including perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (Cl-PFAES), were given to rats via acute intracerebroventricular injection. The field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude of the input/output functions, paired-pulse facilitations, and LTP in vivo were recorded. PFOS and its alternatives inhibited LTP in varying degrees, without significant effects on the normal synaptic transmission. In addition, PFHxS and Cl-PFAES exhibited comparable potential to PFOS in disturbing LTP. The results suggested that acute exposure to PFOS and its alternatives impaired the synaptic plasticity by a postsynaptic rather than a presynaptic mechanism. Besides, the fEPSP amplitude of the baseline was reduced by Cl-PFAES but not by other compounds, indicating that Cl-PFAES might act in a different mode. Providing some electrophysiological evidence and the potential mechanism of the neurotoxicity induced by PFOS and its alternatives, the present study addresses further evaluation of their safety and health risks.

"Invasive crayfish are spreading rapidly across Europe, where they are replacing the native crayfish species and impacting negatively on some other biota. Freshwater crayfish and many benthic fishes share similar habitat and food requirements and hence potentially compete for resources. In this study, we investigated impacts of the introduced signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on fish in stony littoral habitats of two large boreal lakes. We compared the littoral fish community composition and the densities of two common benthic fish species between sites with and without crayfish. To evaluate whether signal crayfish share the same food resources as benthic littoral fish or change their feeding habits, we used mixing models and trophic niche estimates based on analyses of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Both the community composition of littoral fish and the densities of benthic fish species were similar at sites with and without signal crayfish. Even though stable isotope signatures indicated strong dietary overlap between crayfish and benthic fish, the use of food sources and trophic niche widths of fish were not noticeably different between crayfish sites and non-crayfish sites. Our results suggest that, at current densities, the non-native signal crayfish does not have significant impacts on benthic fish in the stony littoral habitats of large boreal lakes.

"A fluorinated electrolyte mixture, containing 1 M LiPF6/fluoroethylene carbonate:bis (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) carbonate (1:1 w:w) with prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone as an electrolyte additive exhibited promising cycling and storage performance in Li(Ni0.4Mn0.4Co0.2)O2/graphite pouch type Li-ion cells tested to 4.5 V. The prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone additive was added to help control gas evolution in the fluorinated electrolyte cells, which was improved but still problematic even with the additive. Cells with the fluorinated electrolyte demonstrated higher impedance in early cycles compared to cells with carbonate solvents and state of the art additives. Symmetric cells were used to show this high impedance originated at the negative electrode/electrolyte interface. Nevertheless, in charge??discharge cycling tests to 4.5 V, cells with the fluorinated electrolyte and 1, 2 or 3% prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone additive, outperformed all non-fluorinated electrolytes with all additives tested.

"Publisher Summary Welding in the context of this chapter is the joining of two or more pieces of metal so that the parts to be joined merge with one another forming a homogeneous whole across the connection. Welding a metal requires the introduction of energy that can be as heat directly or in a form that will convert to heat where it is required. The chapter describes the principal features of the welding processes applied to the materials that are most commonly used in structural, mechanical, and process plant engineering??namely, steels and aluminum alloys. It reviews manual metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, and gas shielded welding. In manual metal arc welding, the welder holds in a clamp or holder, a length of steel wire, coated with a flux consisting of minerals, called a welding electrode or rod; the holder is connected to one pole of an electricity supply. The metal part to be welded is connected to the other pole of the supply and as the welder brings the tip of the rod close to it, an arc starts between them. Submerged arc welding uses a continuous bare wire electrode and a separate flux added over the joint separately in the form of granules or powder. The arc is completely enclosed by the flux so that a high current can be used without the risk of air entrainment or severe spatter but otherwise the flux performs the same functions as the flux in manual metal arc welding.",non-battery
"The self-discharge of Zn anode material is identified as a main factor that can limit the energy density of alkaline Zn??air batteries. Al2O3 has most positive effect on controlling the hydrogen evolution reaction accompanied by corroding Zn anode among various additives. The overpotential for hydrogen evolution is measured by potentio-dynamic polarization analysis. Al-oxide with high overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction is uniformly coated on the surface of Zn powders via chemical solution process. The morphology and composition of the surface-treated and pristine Zn powders are characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD and XPS analyses. Aluminum is distributed homogeneously over the surface of modified Zn powders, indicating uniform coating of Al-oxide, and O1s and Al2p spectra further identified surface coating layer to be the Al-oxide. The Al-oxide coating layer can prevent Zn from exposing to the KOH electrolyte, resulting in minimizing the side reactions within batteries. The 0.25 wt.% aluminum oxide coated Zn anode material provides discharging time of more than 10 h, while the pristine Zn anode delivers only 7 h at 25 mA cm???2. Consequently, a surface-treated Zn electrode can reduce self-discharge which is induced by side reaction such as H2 evolution, resulting in increasing discharge capacity.",battery
"Hydrolysis of organic titanate was used to modify ??-MnO2 to produce a TiO2/MnOx composite as a new anode material with enhanced electrochemical properties for lithium ion battery. The composition, structure, valence state as well as the lithium storage mechanism of the composite have been carefully studied with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction(XRD), electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The electrochemical measurement shows that the specific capacity of the composite stays above 972mAh/g for 100 cycles at a current rate of 100mA/g, which is much better than ??-MnO2. The significant improvement can be ascribed to the involvement of both insertion and conversion lithium storage mechanisms owing to the incorporation of a small amount of TiO2 (???5%) to MnO2, as well as the presence of Mn2O3 in the composite. This new strategy is expected to be extended to improve the electrochemical properties of other metal oxides for lithium ion battery applications.",battery
"All-solid-state sodium batteries are attractive due to the abundance of sodium and advantageous for safe battery operation by avoiding flammable organics and liquids and suppressed dendrite formation. Currently, the lack of a chemically stable sodium solid electrolyte with high ion conductivity at room temperature is one of the challenges for future development of sodium batteries. Herein, we present a NaxCoO2/Nasicon/Na thin-film model sodium solid-state battery using a Sc-substituted Nasicon solid electrolyte with a high ionic conductivity of 4 ?? 10???3 S cm???1. The battery shows a high specific capacity of 150 mAh g???1 at room-temperature and discharge rates of up to 6C. Excellent chemical stability of this solid electrolyte at high voltages of up to 4.2 V increases the accessible sodium (de)intercalation range and battery capacity.

"The synthesis of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and the design of electrode interface with preferable compatibility are critical to realize the bulk-type application of all-solid-state batteries. In order to realize the superior electrochemical performance, argyrodite Li6PS5Cl is a promising solid electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries due to high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. Meanwhile, the solution reprecipitation is a valid process providing intimate ionic contact between electrodes and electrolytes to mitigate the interface incompatibility. Here, a wet-slurry process by dispersing active material (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2), solid electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl), binder (ethyl cellulose) and conductive additives (carbon black) in anhydrous ethanol is developed to fabricate cathode.

"The main aims in the care of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are to minimize morbidity and maximize quality of life. Although no cure exists for ALS, supportive and symptomatic care provided by a specialist multidisciplinary team can improve survival. The basis for supportive management is shifting from expert consensus guidelines towards an evidence-based approach, which encourages the use of effective treatments and could reduce the risk of harm caused by ineffective or unsafe interventions. For example, respiratory support using noninvasive ventilation has been demonstrated to improve survival and quality of life, whereas evidence supporting other respiratory interventions is insufficient. Increasing evidence implicates a causal role for metabolic dysfunction in ALS, suggesting that optimizing nutrition could improve quality of life and survival. The high incidence of cognitive dysfunction and its impact on prognosis is increasingly recognized, although evidence for effective treatments is lacking. A variety of strategies are used to manage the other physical and psychological symptoms, the majority of which have yet to be thoroughly evaluated. The need for specialist palliative care throughout the disease is increasingly recognized. This Review describes the current approaches to symptomatic and supportive care in ALS and outlines the current guidance and evidence for these strategies.

"Seizure-prone EL/Suz mice have been studied as a model of multifactorial epilepsy for five decades. In prior behavioral studies, EL/Suz mice were shown to exhibit heightened locomotor activity, which implies a state of underlying hyperexcitability. The aim of the present study was to establish the premorbid behavioral development of basic motor skills and activity levels of EL/Suz mice, as compared with DDY mice, the control strain that is not seizure-prone. EL/Suz and DDY pups were monitored from Postnatal Day (PND) 3 to assess body weight, surface righting, negative geotaxis, forelimb grip strength, eye opening, habituation to a novel environment, and exploratory behavior in a two-compartment task. EL/Suz mice weighed less from PNDs 3 to 21 and exhibited delayed surface righting (PNDs 3, 5, 7) and negative geotaxis (PNDs 5, 7, 9) responses. EL/Suz and DDY mice differed in their habituation to a novel environment, with EL/Suz mice exhibiting higher activity, both within a single 10-minute session and across the 3 days of testing. EL/Suz and DDY mice also differed in the two-compartment task, with EL/Suz mice exhibiting increased locomotor activity and spending a greater amount of time in the light compartment. Thus, the present findings reveal that EL/Suz mice exhibit some developmental delays, altered habituation to a novel environment, and increased exploratory activity. Overall, the present results demonstrate that the behavioral and physiological phenotype of seizure-prone EL/Suz mice is deviant more than 2 months before the onset of seizure susceptibility.",non-battery
"Twenty four waste cellular phones, manufactured between 2002 and 2011, were selected in order to determine the total heavy metal content in each of their parts (printed circuit boards (PCBs), plastic housing (PH) and liquid crystal display monitors (LCDs)) and compare the results with the permissible limits set by the 2003 Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS). All the selected samples were pulverized and digested with strong acids. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to measure the heavy metal content in each sample.

With the exception of Pb and Cr present in PCBs of mobile phones released before the year 2006, all the other metal concentrations were according to the Directive. Concentration levels of Cd, Hg were lower than the permissible limits set by the EU, either before or after the validity of the 2003 RoHS Directive.

"VO2 as one of the most prospective cathode materials applied for lithium-ion batteries, has appealed increasing attentions owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, unique tunnel structure, as well as low cost.

"Improving the electron conductivity and lithiated structure stability for Si anodes can result in high stable capacity in cells. A Silicon/Wolfram Carbide@Graphene (SW@G) composite anode is designed and produced by a simple two-step ball milling the mixture of coarse-grained Si with good conductive wolfram carbide (WC) and graphite. The SW@G composite consists of multiple-scale WC particles, which are uniformly distributed in amorphous Si matrices, and wrapped by graphene nanosheets (GNs) on the outside. Owing to the unique concrete-like core-shell structure, the wrapping of GNs on the Si improves the conductivity and structural stability of the composite. The inner WC particles which tightly connect the Si and graphene act as the cornerstone to resist large volumetric expansion of Si during charge/discharge, and in particular serve as the high-speed channels of electrons as well as provide more interface paths for Li+ to accelerate their transfer inside the Si. These contribute to the excellent electrochemical properties of SW@G composite anode, including high volumetric capacity (three times higher than that of graphite), superior rate capability, and long-life stable cycleability.

"Studies of polymer electrolyte solutions for lithium-polymer batteries are described. Two different salts, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf), were dissolved in a variety of polymers. The structures were all based upon the ethylene oxide unit for lithium ion solvation, and both linear and comb-branch polymer architectures have been examined. Conductivity, salt diffusion coefficient and transference number measurements demonstrate the superior transport properties of the LiTFSI salt over LiTf. Data obtained on all of these polymers combined with LiTFSI salts suggest that there is a limit to the conductivity achievable at room temperature, at least for hosts containing ethylene oxide units. The apparent conductivity limit is 5??10???5 S/cm at 25??C. Providing that the polymer chain segment containing the ethylene oxide units is at least 5??6 units long, there appears to be little influence of the polymer framework to which the solvating groups are attached. To provide adequate separator function, the mechanical properties may be disconnected from the transport properties by selection of an appropriate architecture combined with an adequately long ethylene oxide chain. For both bulk and interfacial transport of the lithium ions, conductivity data alone is insufficient to understand the processes that occur. Lithium ion transference numbers and salt diffusion coefficients also play a major role in the observed behavior and the transport properties of these polymer electrolyte solutions appear to be quite inadequate for ambient temperature performance. At present, this restricts the use of such systems to high temperature applications. Several suggestions are given to overcome these obstacles.",battery

The as prepared ECC window showed high transparency (>72% for PR-Br), large color contrast, and long capacitive stability over 10000 cycles, by combining non-aqueous acidic electrolyte and precise control of each electrode's working potential using in situ potential matching. Upon introducing a dielectric poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) layer, the blue ECC window made of PR-Br and PANI showed bistable ECC properties, along with a high energy density of 9.7 and 13.5 W h kg???1 with a power density of 75.3 and 58.8 kW kg???1, respectively, for bleaching and coloring. The red ECC window made of Th-OR and PANI also showed a high energy density (10.5 W h kg???1). The energy stored in an ECC window could be transferred to another device, like a battery, to switch the color or to light a LED when the ECC window is connected in series. Thus the ECC window in this study functions as a color switching smart window and a rechargeable battery, to provide a new path to achieve energy saving EC windows with multi-color tunability. The working principle of these ECC windows can be widely applied in various electrochemical devices for multiple functions in one device.

"Future scenarios and assessment studies used to prepare for long-term energy transitions and develop robust strategies to address climate change are highly dependent on the assessment of technology characteristics and availability. The electric power sector in the United States recently experienced a significant cost escalation: e.g., construction costs for large plants such as nuclear and coal-fired power plants doubled between 2003 and 2007. We assess the main drivers of this escalation. While many factors have affected costs, some of the most significant include cost of materials, particularly the price of metals and to a lesser extent cement, possible increases in labor quantity requirements, the aggressive worldwide competition for power plant design and construction resources, driven by high demand in Asia, market and regulatory changes, and general uncertainty about future regulations and climate policies. We recalibrate power sector technology costs in the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) based on an extensive literature review of recent (post-2010) studies and in the process develop a coherent and updated set of current cost and performance assumptions for all major electricity-generating technologies. While current cost and performance assumptions of electricity-generating technologies are key drivers of short-term technology deployment and technology mix in the electricity sector, medium- and long-term deployment pathways are significantly affected by assumed efficiency improvement rates and cost reductions. We develop and demonstrate a method to project efficiency and construction cost of power plants and report a sensitivity analysis to explore the importance of such assumptions in future scenarios generated by GCAM.",battery
"The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has emerged as a viable grid-scale energy storage technology that offers cost-effective energy storage solutions for renewable energy applications. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced for modeling of the transport mechanisms of electrolyte flow, species and charge in the VRFB at the pore scale of the electrodes; that is, at the level where individual carbon fiber geometry and electrolyte flow are directly resolved. The detailed geometry of the electrode is obtained using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and calibrated against experimentally determined pore-scale characteristics (e.g., pore and fiber diameter, porosity, and surface area). The processed XCT data is then used as geometry input for modeling of the electrochemical processes in the VRFB. The flow of electrolyte through the pore space is modeled using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) while the finite volume method (FVM) is used to solve the coupled species and charge transport and predict the performance of the VRFB under various conditions. An electrochemical model using the Butler??Volmer equations is used to provide species and charge coupling at the surfaces of the carbon fibers. Results are obtained for the cell potential distribution, as well as local concentration, overpotential and current density profiles under galvanostatic discharge conditions.

"In 2017, Puerto Rico sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Maria, increasing the risk of fires and carbon monoxide (CO) poisonings. Using a population-based, in-person survey of households with children less than 6??years old in Puerto Rico, we collected data in 2010 concerning the presence of smoke alarms and CO alarms in these households. We generated national estimates by extrapolating the number of households in each stratum using data from the 2010 Census. We determined which household characteristics predicted the presence of these alarms. Of 355 households analyzed, 31% had functional smoke alarms, or an estimated 109,773 households territory wide. The presence of smoke alarms was associated with living in multifamily housing and no child in the household receiving government medical insurance. Public housing or publicly subsidized housing, as compared to owner-occupied housing and unsubsidized rental housing, was associated with having a functional smoke alarm in households with children aged less than 6??years. Based on only six houses having CO alarms, we estimated only 7685 (2%) households had CO alarms.

"Various screening tools have been proposed to identify HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). However, there has been no systematic review of their strengths and weaknesses in detecting HAND when compared to gold standard neuropsychological testing. Thirty-five studies assessing HAND screens that were conducted in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy were retrieved using standard search procedures. Of those, 19 (54??%) compared their screen to standard neuropsychological testing. Studies were characterised by a wide variation in criterion validity primarily due to non-standard definition of neurocognitive impairment, and to the demographic and clinical heterogeneity of samples.

Reversible reduction of O2 to O2 ????? and O2 ????? to O2 2??? take place at E 0 =2.1V and 0.8V vs. Li+/Li, respectively. In the presence of Li+, O2 is reduced to LiO2 first and then to Li2O2. The solubility product constant of Li2O2 is found to be around 10???51, corroborating the hypothesis that electrode passivation by Li2O2 deposition is an important issue that limits the capacity delivered by lithium-oxygen batteries. Enhancing the rate of Li2O2 formation by using different electrode materials would probably lead to faster electrode passivation and hence smaller charge due to oxygen reduction (smaller capacity of the battery). On the contrary, soluble redox catalysts can not only increase the reaction rate of Li2O2 formation but also avoid electrode passivation since the fast diffusion of the soluble redox catalyst would displace the formation of Li2O2 at a sufficient distance from the electrode surface.",battery
"Coal-based coke powder is a by-product when coke is smashed for metallurgy and chemical industry. There is a vast output of coke powder every year around world, most of which is combusted as cheap fuel or abandoned directly. In this work, the electrochemical performance of graphitized boron-doped coal-based coke powder as anode for lithium ion batteries was investigated. The effects of boron content and graphitization temperature on the anode performance of boron-doped coal-based coke powder were also investigated in this paper. Results showed that a reversible capacity of 360.3mAh/g of boron-doped coal-based coke powder can be obtained, while that of unboron-doped was 292.9mAh/g. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for the boron-doped coal-based coke powder showed that the distance between carbon layers was lowered by a proper amount of doped boron and higher graphitization temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis was carried out to explain the effect of boron doping on the electrochemical performances of coal-based coke anodes.",battery

"Hollow Sn nanostructures were obtained by simply controlling PVP addition in a solution-based reduction process. These nanostructures are assembled by many Sn nanoparticles with an inner void structure in the center. As an anode in Na-ion battery, the hollow Sn nanoparticles present improved cycling stability and capability in comparison with solid Sn nanoparticles, clearly indicating enhanced electrochemical properties for pure Sn anode in Na-ion battery. Moreover, their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge/discharge profiles reveal the hollow structure not only maintains much higher capacity at large volumetric shrinkage process, but also provides structural stability and facilitated charge transfer in Sn anodes during the electrochemical reaction. Therefore, this hollow Sn nanostructure could provide new insight towards the exploration and design of alloy anode materials in Na-ion battery.",battery
"Despite increasing interest in the attentional biases of pain patients towards pain-related stimuli, there have been no investigations of whether the main caregivers of chronic pain patients also selectively attend to pain-related information. We compared the attentional biases to painful or happy faces of 120 chronic pain patients, 118 caregivers, and 50 controls. Analyses found that both patients and caregivers demonstrated biases towards painful faces that were not observed in control participants or to happy faces. Those patients and caregivers who were high in fear of pain demonstrated greater biases than those low in fear of pain, and the biases of the high-in-fear-of-pain group differed significantly from zero. When sub-groups of caregivers were compared, it was found that biases towards painful faces were not observed for those caregivers who accurately identified the level of pain the patient currently reported. In contrast, those caregivers who overestimated or underestimated the patients?? pain demonstrated biases that were significantly greater than zero. These results add to the growing weight of evidence suggesting that biases towards pain-related stimuli are observed in chronic pain patients, but that the nature of the stimuli is important. In addition, the results suggest that caregivers, particularly those who either under- or overestimate the level of pain that the patient reports, also demonstrate similar biases. Future research should investigate the links between caregivers?? biases and the way in which caregivers respond to pain.",non-battery
"We characterized high-power lithium-ion cells in terms of performance and cycle and calendar life at 45??C. Among other parameters, we measured the C/25 capacity every 4 weeks during the test. Differentiation of the C/25 voltage versus capacity data with respect to capacity (dV/dQ) has been used to elucidate another type of side reaction at the anode. In cycle-life cells, with their higher capacity throughput, the analysis showed that one phase transition (a peak in the profile) was disappearing with time. In contrast, this effect was not seen in calendar-life cells.",battery
"Slow-scan rate cyclic voltammetry (SSCV), potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been applied simultaneously to study Li ion intercalation into V2O5 films prepared by evaporative vacuum-deposition on Pt foils. Two different films, 1600 and 3600 ?? thick, were used to study the influence of the film's thickness on the major electroanalytical characteristics of these intercalation electrodes. Modeling of the impedance spectrum related to the thin V2O5 film was performed using an equivalent circuit analog including the following elements: three R ?????? C semicircles (covering the high-frequency domain) and finite-length Warburg in sequence with the intercalation capacity (a straight line of unit slope at intermediate frequencies, and a sloping capacitive line at the very low frequencies). Sharp minima on D versus E plots, which are observed in the vicinity of the cyclic voltammetric peaks, present further evidence of very high, attractive electron??ion interactions during Li ion intercalation into the V2O5 electrode, as was already described for similar processes in graphite and some transition metal oxides: Li x CoO2, Li x NiO2, Li x Co y Ni1???y O2 and Li x Mn2O4.

"With the aim of developing lithium ion batteries with a long life and high efficiency for power storage, we experimentally evaluated combinations of cathode and anode active materials, in which batteries are able to obtain over 4000 cycles or 10 years of life. An acceleration method was evaluated using coin cells. We found that changing the current density was effective for evaluating battery life, since the logarithm of the cycle life showed a linear relationship to current density. Based on the current density increasing method, various combinations of cathode and anode active materials were tested. The cell system of LiCoO2/Li4/3Ti5/3O4 clearly showed a long life of about 4000 cycles. The energy density of the cell using the Li4/3Ti5/3O4 anode is obviously smaller than that using a graphite anode, the cell with Li4/3Ti5/3O4 anode was thought to have some merit especially in the large-scale-layer-built type battery by the applicability of the Al anode collector and a light weight battery case.",battery
"We show that anodes made by depositing thin films of polymer-derived silicon oxycarbide (SiCO) on copper have properties that are comparable to, or better than that of powder-based SiCO anodes. The great advantage of the thin film architecture is its simplicity, both in manufacturing and in application. The films are produced by spraying a film of the liquid polymer-precursor on copper, and then converting it into SiCO by heating at ???1000??C; at this point they are ready for constructing electrochemical cells. They show a capacity of ???1000mAhg???1, 100% coulombic efficiency, good capacity at very high C-rates, and minimal fading at ???60 cycles. However, if the films are thick they delaminate due to the volume change as lithium is cycled in and out. The transition from thin-film to thick-film behavior occurs when the SiCO films are approximately 1??m thick. An analytical method for estimating this transition is presented.",battery
"The mechanical instability of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer in lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries causes significant side reactions resulting in Li-ion consumption and cell impedance rise by forming further SEI layers, which eventually leads to battery capacity fade and power fade. In this paper, the composition-/structure-dependent elasticity of the SEI layer is investigated via Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements coupled with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, and atomistic calculations. It is observed that the inner layer is stiffer than the outer layer. The measured Young's moduli are mostly in the range of 0.2??4.5 GPa, while some values above 80 GPa are also observed. This wide variation of the observed elastic modulus is elucidated by atomistic calculations with a focus on chemical and structural analysis. The numerical analysis shows the Young's moduli range from 2.4 GPa to 58.1 GPa in the order of the polymeric, organic, and amorphous inorganic components. The crystalline inorganic component (LiF) shows the highest value (135.3 GPa) among the SEI species. This quantitative observation on the elasticity of individual components of the SEI layer must be essential to analyzing the mechanical behavior of the SEI layer and to optimizing and controlling it.",battery
"Abstract Climate change mitigation requires the development of new processes to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The products of CO2 utilization can supplement or replace chemical feedstocks, fine chemicals, pharmaceutical, and polymers. Carbon capture and utilization based on innovative electroreduction processes is one of the suggested routes to reduce the use of coal and oil as carbon sources due to the recycling of carbon. Some chemicals may be produced using carbon dioxide, decreasing the use of natural resources.

The techniques discussed are for multiprocessor systems-on-chips (MPSoC) processor cores, the on-chip memory hierarchy, the on-chip communication system, and MPSoC energy-aware software. The majority of the techniques are derived from existing uni-processor energy-aware systems that take on new dimensions in the MPSoC space. Techniques for energy and power consumption reduction are successfully applied at all levels of the design space in uni-processor systems??circuit, logic gate, functional unit, processor, system software, and application software levels. The primary focus has been on reducing active power. As technology continues to scale up, accompanied by reductions in the supply and threshold voltages, the percentage of the power budget due to standby energy has driven the development of additional techniques for reducing standby energy.",non-battery
"The full-length Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality - 2nd Edition (SNAP-2, Clark et al. 2014) and various derivative versions were developed as measures of normal- and pathological-range personality traits. We report herein on the development and initial validation of the SNAP Brief Other-Description Rating Form (SNAP-BORF), an abbreviated version of the SNAP Other-Description Rating Form (ORF; Harlan and Clark Assessment, 6, 131??145, 1999). Our goal was to create a more efficient SNAP informant short form by making items more succinct rather than by eliminating items. SNAP-ORF word count was reduced by 68%, and the 1.5-page SNAP-BORF can be completed in approximately 10??min, one-third to one-half the time required to complete the SNAP-ORF. Mean-level differences between the SNAP-ORF and SNAP-BORF scales were negligible for all scales except propriety. Using exploratory factor analysis, we found the SNAP-BORF had a three-factor structure (NA vs. Low PA, Disinhibition vs. Constraint, and Antagonism) broadly consistent with extant literature. The SNAP-BORF showed good convergent/ discriminant validity with respect to the SNAP-family measures as well as measures of normal personality and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and worry. Results indicated that the SNAP-BORF is a useful measure when a very brief informant assessment of adaptive and maladaptive personality is needed.

"Single phase Li4Ti5O12 powder with porous particle structure is synthesized via a simple, mild and productive citric-acid combustion method. The Li4Ti5O12 particle is composed of submicro-scaled grains with size of 100??200nm. The synthesized Li4Ti5O12 shows high reversible capacity (ca. 165mAhg???1 at 0.5C), excellent rate-capability (ca. 115 and 100mAhg???1 at 10 and 20C, respectively) and high temperature cycling stability (50??C). Under expanded cut-off voltage range of 0.01??2.5V, it delivers a high specific capacity of ca. 230 and 170mAhg???1 at 0.5 and 10C, respectively, while maintaining an excellent cycling stability. The synthesized Li4Ti5O12 shows fast de-lithiation but slow lithiation kinetic processes. When discharged at constant 1C while charged at 10, 20 and 30C, respectively, the specific capacity of 162, 160 and 158mAhg???1 can be achieved. The excellent electrochemical performance of the combustion synthesized Li4Ti5O12 is ascribed to the porous particle structure and small grain size feature, which ensure the good contact with electrolyte and reduce the lithium ion/electron diffusion distance, and therefore enhance the electrode reaction process.",battery
"The cells applied with a three-dimensionally (3D) patterned Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) electrode showed good performance as a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. The 3D-patterned electrode was fabricated with a printing apparatus and has many lined patterns with a high aspect ratio standing in line on a current collector. The cell using 3D-patterned electrode showed much better rate capability than that using a conventional flat electrode. In this research, cyclic voltammetry was carried out to investigate the mechanism realizing the high rates of charging and discharging in 3D-patterned electrode. Various types of line patterns were fabricated for 3D electrode by using LTO electrode slurry, and the influences of basic specifications of electrode structure (the space between two neighboring electrode lines, the height and width of electrode) on the charge and discharge characteristics were evaluated to optimize the electrode pattern. In addition, the electrode performance was discussed from the viewpoints of ohmic resistance and charge-transfer resistance of the cells with 3D-patterned and conventional flat electrodes.",battery
"The effect of potential cycling conditions on redox processes observed in the potential region of electrochemical stability window, between hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, of platinum, gold and glassy carbon electrodes has been investigated in aqueous lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LITFSI) solutions with concentration ranging from 1 to 21 molal (moles of salt/kg of water). Following potential cycling to positive potential upon which oxidation of Pt is barely observable in contrast to Au, which is characterized by a well-defined oxidation wave, both electrodes showed on the return scan a cathodic wave corresponding to the electrochemical reduction of corresponding metal oxides. In the potential region more negative than about 0 V, voltammograms recorded by avoiding scanning to a positive potential limit reaching the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction, show no well-defined cathodic waves prior to hydrogen evolution reaction. This provides strong evidence that TFSI anions are not electrochemically reduced in this potential region at Pt, Au and glassy carbon electrodes. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of electrode surface, following potential cycling to a value negative enough to reach the onset of hydrogen evolution, showed formation of surface layer with a high fluorine/sulfur ratio (higher than 3 expected for TFSI) that could be explained by chemical degradation of TFSI by species generated during hydrogen evolution with preferential dissolution of sulfur-based compounds.",battery

"This paper reviews the system components, modeling, and control of microgrids for future smart buildings in current literature. Microgrids are increasingly widely studied due to their reliability in the event of grid failure or emergency, their incorporation of renewable energy sources, and the potential they represent for overall cost reduction for the consumer. Greater accuracy in microgrid modeling enables the design of more advanced control methods, resulting in better objective optimization. This paper begins with an overview of microgrids and their components, their importance to both utility providers and building owners, and typical problems that they may be used to solve, as well as modeling challenges that microgrid researchers may face. An overview of microgrid control and optimization is given in terms of objectives, constraints, and optimization methods. Microgrid modeling is a complex task due to the number, variety, and complexity of microgrid components, which can include building loads, distributed energy resources, and energy storage systems. Various component modeling methods including physics-based and data-driven models are reviewed, to include battery degradation models. Furthermore, this paper provides a review of various data-driven forecasting methods for the microgrid controls. Different types of control methods including rule-based and model predictive control are reviewed, including latest occupancy-based model predictive control for buildings. Lastly, a discussion of current challenges that may be faced by researchers is presented, as well as future directions.",battery
"Owing to data collection challenges, the vertical variation in population in cities and particulate air pollution are typically not accounted for in exposure assessments, which may lead to misclassification of exposures based on elevation of residency. To better assess this misclassification, the vertical distribution of the potentially highly exposed population (PHEP), defined as all residents within the 100-m buffer zone of above-ground highways or the 200-m buffer zone of a highway-tunnel exit, was estimated for four floor categories in Boston??s Chinatown (MA, USA) using the three-dimensional digital geography methodology. Vertical profiles of particle number concentration (7??3000??nm; PNC) and particulate matter (PM2.5) mass concentration were measured by hoisting instruments up the vertical face of an 11-story (35-m) building near the study area throughout the day on multiple days. The concentrations from all the profiles (n=23) were averaged together for each floor category. As measurement elevation increased from 0 to 35??m PNC decreased by 7.7%, compared with 3.6% for PM2.5. PHEP was multiplied by the average PNC for each floor category to assess exposures for near-highway populations. The results show that adding temporally-averaged vertical air pollution data had a small effect on residential ambient exposures for our study population; however, greater effects were observed when individual days were considered (e.g., winds were off the highways).",non-battery
"Thin films of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP), with a thickness between 80 nm and 320 nm are prepared by ion beam sputter deposition. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy show that the films exhibit the desired structure, morphology, and chemical composition. Chrono potentiometry and cyclic voltammetry are carried out to determine the electrochemical behavior of the LFP films. Within these electrochemical measurements, a well-defined lithium intercalation/deintercalation reaction at around 3.45 V vs. Li/Li+ and a specific capacity of 104 mAh g???1 are observed. Moreover, a quite high cycling stability is found: Measurement data at 1C rate indicate a capacity fading of only 20% after ???1700 charge??discharge cycles. In addition, the diffusion of lithium within the LFP thin films is studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic intermittent transition technique. Within these measurements it is observed that the lithium kinetics in the sputter-deposited thin films is about two orders of magnitude faster, compared to the powder material and thin films deposited by pulsed laser deposition. This behavior may be explained by the strong texture of the sputtered films.",battery

Grafting is commonly used to relieve damage caused by soil-borne diseases and to enhance the nutrient uptake in watermelon plants. Certain reports have shown the proteomic changes of plant tissues involved in grafting, while little information about the secretome after watermelon grafting is available. To gain insight into the root-secreted protein profile, root exudates of three types of seedlings (own-root watermelon (W), grafted-root watermelon (WB) and own-root bottle gourd (B)) were collected under hydroponic conditions, desalted and concentrated using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices, and separated by one-dimensional SDS??PAGE. Principal component analysis revealed that the protein profile was distinctly altered after grafting, and the diversity of root-secreted proteins of WB was significantly higher than that of W and B. Moreover, analysis by LC-QTOF/MS/MS revealed that some proteins associated with biotic and abiotic stress resistance appeared in response to grafting, such as disease resistance protein At4g27190, callose synthase, HVA22, and Clp protease. These results indicate that grafting can shift the root-secreted protein profile and thus could increase stress resistance. This study would help to reveal the mechanisms of disease resistance and growth promotion achieved through grafting.",non-battery

A number of clear trends emerge: dynamical motion in both PEO and V2O5 is significantly reduced in the interface region, where it is also clear that relatively stable local structural configurations develop. These appear to be controlled by interactions between the ether oxygens of the PEO and the V???O bonds which form the surface of the V2O5.

"The thermal management of batteries for use in electric and hybrid vehicles is vital for safe operation and performance in all climates. Lithium-ion batteries are the focus of the electric vehicle market due to their high power density and life cycle longevity. To investigate the performance of two liquid cooling designs for lithium-ion battery packs, a series of numerical models were created. The effects of channel number, hole diameter, mass flow rate and inlet locations are investigated on a mini channel-cooled cylinder (MCC) and a channel-cooled heat sink (CCHS); those being the two most efficient concepts. The results show that the maximum temperature can be controlled to under 313 K for both designs with mass flow rates over 5E-05 kg/s, and maximum temperature variation can be controlled to less than 3.15 K for both designs. Considering both maximum temperature and temperature uniformity, the MCC design provides superior performance to the CCHS. The maximum temperature of the MCC is less than that of the CCHS but the temperature is less uniform. The MCC is a more complex design and so would incur greater manufacturing costs. But, it increases the efficiency of such systems for the rechargeable battery packs of the electric vehicle industry.",battery

"Publisher Summary A large number of people, representing a variety of diagnostic categories exhibit self injurious behavior, including autism, childhood schizophrenia, intellectual disability, visual impairment, emotional disturbance, and learning disabilities. This chapter describes the analyses of different intervention methods for preventing self-injurious behavior and its devastating effects, such as primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Both prevalence studies and stimulus control studies of self-injurious behavior suggest that there are risk factors, which, if averted, would decrease the probability of onset of self-injurious behavior. The preventive techniques for averting self-injurious behavior or preventing its development would avoid much human suffering, and be much more cost-effective than current methods; however, the area of early identification and intervention with self-injurious behavior is in its infancy. With the help of the new genetics and advances in the neurobiology of self-injurious behavior, drugs can be prescribed much more effectively, with more specificity and fewer serious side effects than ever before. But, much work remains to be done to have better diagnostic instruments to guide the selection of psychotropic drugs for the appropriate complex disorder related to self-injurious behavior. The chapter also presents a variety of empirically supported, rational treatment procedures for self injurious behavior and also includes noncontingent restraint, sensory integration therapy, and multisensory environments. However, whether changing the context, in which behavior interventions occur, will be sufficient to decrease all self-injurious behavior remains to be seen.",non-battery

The system studied consists of a heat transfer fluid circulating between either of the on-board hot and cold thermal storage units, which we refer to as thermal batteries, and a liquid??air heat exchanger that provides heat exchange with the incoming air to the vehicle cabin. Each thermal battery is a shell-and-tube configuration where a heat transfer fluid flows through parallel tubes, which are surrounded by PCM within a larger shell. The system model incorporates computationally inexpensive semi-analytic solution to the conjugated laminar forced convection and phase change problem within the battery and accounts for airside heat exchange using the Number of Transfer Units (NTUs) method for the liquid??air heat exchanger. Using this approach, we are able to obtain an accurate solution to the complex heat transfer problem within the battery while also incorporating the impact of the airside heat transfer on the overall system performance. The implemented model was benchmarked against a numerical study for a melting process and against full system experimental data for solidification using paraffin wax as the PCM. Through modeling, we demonstrate the importance of capturing the airside heat exchange impact on system performance, and we investigate system response to dynamic operating conditions, e.g., air recirculation.",battery
"Observations and modeling are used to assess potential impacts of sediment releases due to dam removals on the Hudson River estuary. Watershed sediment loads are calculated based on sediment-discharge rating curves for gauges covering 80% of the watershed area. The annual average sediment load to the estuary is 1.2 Mt, of which about 0.6 Mt comes from side tributaries. Sediment yield varies inversely with watershed area, with regional trends that are consistent with substrate erodibility. Geophysical and sedimentological surveys in seven subwatersheds of the Lower Hudson were conducted to estimate the mass and composition of sediment trapped behind dams. Impoundments were classified as (1) active sediment traps, (2) run-of-river sites not actively trapping sediment, and (3) dammed natural lakes and spring-fed ponds. Based on this categorization and impoundment attributes from a dam inventory database, the total mass of impounded sediment in the Lower Hudson watershed is estimated as 4.9 ?? 1.9 Mt. This represents about 4 years of annual watershed supply, which is small compared with some individual dam removals and is not practically available given current dam removal rates. More than half of dams impound drainage areas less than 1 km2, and play little role in downstream sediment supply. In modeling of a simulated dam removal, suspended sediment in the estuary increases modestly near the source during discharge events, but otherwise effects on suspended sediment are minimal. Fine-grained sediment deposits broadly along the estuary and coarser sediment deposits near the source, with transport distance inversely related to settling velocity.",non-battery
"Epidural spinal cord electrical stimulation (ESCS) has been used as a means to facilitate locomotor recovery in spinal cord injured humans. Electrode arrays, instead of conventional pairs of electrodes, are necessary to investigate the effect of ESCS at different sites. These usually require a large number of implanted wires, which could lead to infections. This paper presents the design, fabrication and evaluation of a novel flexible active array for ESCS in rats. Three small (1.7??mm2) and thin (100????m) application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are embedded in the polydimethylsiloxane-based implant. This arrangement limits the number of communication tracks to three, while ensuring maximum testing versatility by providing independent access to all 12 electrodes in any configuration. Laser-patterned platinum-iridium foil forms the implant??s conductive tracks and electrodes. Double rivet bonds were employed for the dice microassembly. The active electrode array can deliver current pulses (up to 1??mA, 100 pulses per second) and supports interleaved stimulation with independent control of the stimulus parameters for each pulse. The stimulation timing and pulse duration are very versatile. The array was electrically characterized through impedance spectroscopy and voltage transient recordings. A prototype was tested for long term mechanical reliability when subjected to continuous bending. The results revealed no track or bond failure. To the best of the authors?? knowledge, this is the first time that flexible active electrode arrays with embedded electronics suitable for implantation inside the rat??s spinal canal have been proposed, developed and tested in vitro.",non-battery

The author had studied the way to maintain this system after operating for three years (2004??2006). The maintenance methods are classified into three parts. They are electrical, mechanical and component maintenance. Then the author used the maintenance check list for building-top GPV that author had developed. The period for planned maintenance was on July 2004, July 2005 and July 2006. The results are as follows: 1. The time for GPV shutdown system is 232h or 0.88% of system operating time. 2. The maintenance quantities are 17 times. They are 13 times for electrical maintenance and four times for component maintenance. 3. The time required for maintenance is 50h. Thirty-six hours for electrical maintenance and 14h for component maintenance. 4.

"The ionic conduction in a novel solid sodium-ion conductor of Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO) is investigated from the point of view of defect chemistry. NZTO shows an ionic conductivity of 0.57 mS cm???1 at room temperature, and the grain bulk conductivity and the grain-boundary conductivity are individually measured using the AC impedance spectroscopy at temperatures down to ???30 ??C. The grain-boundary conductivities are about two orders of magnitude lower than those of the grain bulk; such a phenomenon can be ascribed to the Schottky barrier at the grain boundaries of the NZTO electrolyte. The concentration and mobility of the charge carriers in the grain bulk are calculated from the grain bulk conductivity. The concentration and mobility of the charge carriers and the Schottky barrier height can be tuned by doping; the ionic conductivity of NZTO is enhanced to 0.83 mS cm???1 by the doping of 2.5 mol% Ga at the Zn sites, because the Ga-doping increases the concentration and mobility of the charge carriers, and lowers the Schottky barrier height.",battery
"Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) thin films have been fabricated by electrophoretic deposition technique in this study. The supercapacitors built from such thin film electrodes have exhibited near-ideal rectangular cyclic voltammograms even at a scan rate as high as 1000mVs???1 and a high specific power density over 20kWkg???1. More importantly, the supercapacitors showed superior frequency response, with a frequency ??knee?? at about 7560Hz, which is more than 70 times higher than the highest ??knee?? frequency (100Hz) so far reported for such supercapacitors. Our study also demonstrated that these carbon nanotube thin films can serve as a coating layer over ordinary current collectors to drastically enhance the electrode performance, indicating the huge potential in supercapacitor and battery manufacturing. Finally, it is clear that electrophoretic deposition is a promising technique for massive fabrication of carbon nanotube electrodes for various electronic devices.",battery
"This study aims at analyzing the response of Li-ion cells and at identifying the hazards and governing phenomena from hard to soft external short circuit conditions. 10 Ah pouch cells and 4.5 mAh coin cells were short circuited while synchronized current, potential and temperature signals, audio, IR and visual video recordings were registered. The anode, cathode and separator harvested from the cells were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, micro X-ray Computed Tomography and 3D-profilometry. The complex short circuit behavior obtained can be described by 3 regions: In the first region 274C-rate is observed which is mainly governed by the cell's double and diffusion layer discharge. In the second region, the current drops significantly to 50??60C-rate where mass transport becomes the current limiting factor. The maximum temperature (77??121 ??C) is reached and cell rupture, venting and electrolyte leakage may occur. In the final, third region the current decline continues due to the decaying electromotive force. The normalized external/internal resistance ratio is found to be the main influential factor on current and hazards rather than the external resistance or the capacity of the cell. The implications on the relevance and fitness-for-purpose of external short circuit test in standards are outlined.",battery
"Background Neurocognitive impairments are the strongest predictor of functional deficits in schizophrenia, but adaptive (i.e., functional) capacity, typically measured with performance-based assessments, yields an objective index of current abilities, whereas real-world functional performance relies on observations of community activity. However, limited experiences in the community may limit the acquisition, retention, or expression of these skills. Methods We examined the frequency of engagement in behaviors that are assessed in the current ??gold standard?? in person functional capacity assessment. The UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (i.e., UPSA) examines skills associated with recreational engagement, handling money, scheduling appointments, and navigating public transportation. We used neurocognition, experience, and UPSA performance as predictors of the relationships among cognition and real-world functioning variables. Results Neurocognition was a significant correlate of UPSA scores regardless of whether it was forced into the model before or after prior experience, whereas experience was only a significant predictor of UPSA scores when entered before neurocognition. Further, functional capacity, neurocognition, and experience were significant predictors of real-world outcomes and experience remained a significant predictor regardless of the order it was entered into the model. Conclusions The amount of current experience with functional tasks is not a rate-limiter of the relationships between neurocognition and functional capacity but does account for some previously unexplained variance in the functional capacity??everyday functioning relationship. These findings underscore the importance of neurocognitive deficits as they relate to functional capacity in schizophrenia, and suggest an incremental functional cost of limited experience with independent living.",non-battery
"A number of pharmacological agents for treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia are currently in development. Unresolved questions regarding the design of clinical trials in this area were discussed at an international meeting in Florence, Italy in April 2012. Participants included representatives from academia, the pharmaceutical industry, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Prior to the meeting, participants submitted key questions for debate and discussion. Responses to the questions guided the discussion during the meeting. The group reached agreement on a number of issues: (1) study subjects should be under the age of 65; (2) subjects should be excluded for symptoms of depression that do not overlap with negative symptoms; (3) functional measures should not be required as a co-primary in negative symptom trials; (4) information from informants should be included for ratings when available; (5) Phase 2 negative symptom trials should be 12weeks and 26weeks is preferred for Phase 3 trials; (6) prior to entry into a negative symptom study, subjects should demonstrate clinical stability for a period of 4 to 6months by collection of retrospective information; and (7) prior to entry, the stability of negative and positive symptoms should be confirmed prospectively for four weeks or longer.

" Hearing impairment is the most common body system disability in veterans. In 2008, nearly 520,000 veterans had a disability for hearing loss through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Changes in eligibility for hearing aid services, along with the aging population, contributed to a greater than 300% increase in the number of hearing aids dispensed from 1996 to 2006. In 2006, the VA committed to having no wait times for patient visits while providing quality clinically-appropriate care. One approach to achieving this goal is the use of group visits as an alternative to individual visits. We sought to determine: 1) if group hearing aid fitting and follow-up visits were at least as effective as individual visits, and 2) whether group visits lead to cost savings through the six month period after the hearing aid fitting. We describe the rationale, design, and characteristics of the baseline cohort of the first randomized clinical trial to study the impact of group versus individual hearing aid fitting and follow-up visits.",non-battery
"Different LiCoO2 thin films are prepared with radio-frequency (RF) sputtering technique. The physical and electrochemical properties of the films are characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering spectroscopy (RS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and charge??discharge experiments. The films obtained at high sputtering power such as 150W or 200W which are composed of bigger particles or larger pieces of the target material exhibit better electrochemical performance than the films obtained at low sputtering powers. It should avoid further annealing process of the thin film electrodes. The experimental results have explained why the as-deposited films become better crystallized and therefore their charge??discharge performance is further improved with the increase of the sputtering power.",battery
"While it has been hypothesized that brown adipocytes responsible for mammalian thermogenesis are absent in birds, the existence of beige fat has yet to be studied directly. The present study tests the hypothesis that beige fat emerges in birds as a mechanism of physiological adaptation to cold environments. Subcutaneous neck adipose tissue from cold-acclimated or triiodothyronine (T3)-treated chickens exhibited increases in the expression of avian uncoupling protein (avUCP, an ortholog of mammalian UCP2 and UCP3) gene and some known mammalian beige adipocyte-specific markers. Morphological characteristics of white adipose tissues of treated chickens showed increased numbers of both small and larger clusters of multilocular fat cells within the tissues. Increases in protein levels of avUCP and mitochondrial marker protein, voltage-dependent anion channel, and immunohistochemical analysis for subcutaneous neck fat revealed the presence of potentially thermogenic mitochondria-rich cells. This is the first evidence that the capacity for thermogenesis may be acquired by differentiating adipose tissue into beige-like fat for maintaining temperature homeostasis in the subcutaneous fat ??neck warmer?? in chickens exposed to a cold environment.

"Although ??9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other mixed CB1/CB2 receptor agonists are well established to elicit antinociceptive effects, their psychomimetic actions and potential for abuse have dampened enthusiasm for their therapeutic development. Conversely, CB2 receptor-selective agonists have been shown to reduce pain and inflammation, without eliciting apparent cannabinoid behavioral effects. In the present study, we developed a novel ethyl sulfonamide THC analog, O-3223, and compared its pharmacological effects to those of the potent, mixed CB1/CB2 receptor agonist, CP55,940, in a battery of preclinical pain models. Competitive cannabinoid receptor binding experiments revealed that O-3223 was approximately 80-fold more selective for CB2 than CB1 receptors. Additionally, O-3223 behaved as a full CB2 receptor agonist in [35S]GTP??S binding. O-3223 reduced nociceptive behavior in both phases of the formalin test, reduced thermal hyperalgesia in the chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI) model, and reduced edema and thermal hyperalgesia elicited by intraplantar injection of LPS. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with the CB2 receptor-selective antagonist SR144528, but not by the CB1 receptor antagonist, rimonabant. Unlike CP55,940, O-3223 did not elicit acute antinociceptive effects in the hot-plate test, hypothermia, or motor disturbances, as assessed in the rotarod test. These data indicate that the CB2 receptor-selective agonist, O-3223, reduces inflammatory and neuropathic nociception, without affecting basal nociception or eliciting overt behavioral effects. Moreover, this compound can serve as a template to develop new CB2 receptor agonists with increased receptor selectivity and increased potency in treating inflammatory and neuropathic pain.",non-battery
"Generally, routing algorithms for opportunistic networks rely on the fact that nodes are willing to accept data from other nodes under any circumstances, but this is not the case. Selfish nodes might not want to participate in the routing process for various reasons, such as low resources (e.g. battery, memory, CPU, and network bandwidth), fear of malicious data from unknown users, or even lack of interest in helping nodes from other communities. Therefore, these types of nodes should be detected and avoided in the routing process. Moreover, incentive mechanisms that reward nodes when they actively take part in the network and punish them when they do not, should be employed where possible. In this paper, we propose SENSE, a novel social-based collaborative content and context-based selfish node detection algorithm with an incentive mechanism, which aims to reduce the issues of having selfish nodes in an opportunistic network. Since local information may not be sufficient to reach an informed decision, nodes running SENSE collaborate through gossiping, for the final goal of detecting selfish nodes, punishing and avoiding them. We compare our approach to an existing algorithm (IRONMAN) and show that it behaves better in terms of network performance and detection accuracy. Moreover, we show that SENSE behaves well even when we simulate the existence of devices with batteries that get depleted, thus rendering them inactive for given time periods.",non-battery

In this work, the stability of commercial spinel Li4Ti5O12 material in air has been characterized by a series of physical and electrochemical techniques. First-principles calculations indicate that Li4Ti5O12 is lithium-truncated at the surface. This explains why it tends to absorb H2O and CO2 to form Li2CO3 but the formation of Li2CO3 does not significantly impact its electrochemical performances.",battery
"There is a substantial amount of public concern about patient safety, as, according to estimates from major studies, hundreds of thousands die in hospitals each year all over the developed world as a result of medical errors that could have been prevented. Unprecedented research commissioned by the EU has found that almost one out of every four families has experienced a serious medical error. Greek citizens concerning about serious medical errors in the hospital environment, were at the top of the list. Greek Ombudsman's report on medical errors has raised the debate among health policy makers as to the appropriate response to the problem. Proposals range from the implementation of nationwide mandatory reporting with public release of performance data, to voluntary reporting and quality-assurance efforts that protect the confidentiality of error-related data. Any successful safety program will first require a national effort to make significant investments in information systems, along with providing an environment and education that enables to contribute to an active quality improvement process. In this paper we propose the development and implementation of Medical Error Reporting Information System (MERIS), in order to identify, collect, analyse and report medical errors and patient adverse events, as a tool for enhancing patient safety and health care quality.

"Subjective ratings of fatigue are increasingly being used as part of a suite of tools to assess fatigue-related risk on the road and in the workplace. There is some debate however, as to whether individuals can accurately gauge their own fatigue states, particularly under conditions of sleep restriction. It is also unclear which references are used by individuals to assess fatigue ?? for example prior sleep, time of day, workload, or previous ratings. The current study used a sophisticated laboratory protocol to examine the independent contributions of sleep, circadian phase and sleep debt to fatigue ratings. Importantly, participants had no knowledge of time of day, how much sleep they were getting, or how long they were awake. Twenty-eight healthy, young males participated in one of two conditions of a 28h forced desynchrony protocol ?? severe sleep restriction (4.7h sleep and 23.3h wake) or moderate sleep restriction (7h sleep and 21h wake). Fatigue ratings were provided prior to and following each sleep period using the Samn??Perelli fatigue scale. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to analyse the effects of circadian phase, sleep dose and study day. Results demonstrated an effect of circadian phase on both pre-sleep and post-sleep fatigue ratings. The significant effect of study day is interpreted as an effect of circadian time, as opposed to accumulating sleep debt. An effect of sleep dose was only seen in post-sleep fatigue ratings. The findings suggest that post-sleep fatigue ratings may be sensitive to prior sleep and may be useful as an indicator of fatigue-related risk, particularly when triangulated with information about recent total sleep time.",non-battery

For this purpose, potential step technique using a microelectrode was applied. Two possible rate-determining steps, the diffusion of Li+ ion vacancies and the reaction between interstitial Li+ ions and Li+ ion vacancies, were assumed, and we found the diffusion of Li+ ion vacancies is the rate-determining step in the present study. We also evaluated the exchange current density (i 0) of the Li/Li+ couple reaction and ionic conductivity (??) of each solid electrolyte. Both i 0 and ?? were increased as the x value was increased, suggesting that the conductivity of Li+ ions or the rate of the diffusion of Li+ ion vacancies was closely related to the rate of the Li/Li+ couple reaction.",battery

"Although prey capture by cnidarians is mediated through nematocysts, their influence on prey selection by cnidarians remains poorly documented. The difficulty in visualizing nematocyst??prey interactions remains the chief obstacle to understanding how the wide variety of nematocyst types influences the mechanics of prey capture. One solution to this limitation has been to assign functional roles to nematocysts based on morphological characters of discharged cnidae. Here we report results of an alternative approach based upon dynamic traits of nematocyst discharge. We examined tubule lengths, tubule discharge velocities and net-to-gross displacement ratios of tubules of discharging nematocysts possessed by the cosmopolitan scyphomedusa, Cyanea capillata. This nematocyst assemblage consisted of euryteles, birhopaloids and three different isorhizas ?? a-isorhizas, A-isorhizas and O-isorhizas. Dynamic traits varied little within each nematocyst type but there were significant differences between the different types. Most importantly, dynamic traits varied significantly within a broad category of nematocyst ?? the isorhizas ?? indicating that conventional classification schemes that infer function based on broad nematocyst categories may not appropriately describe the functional roles of these nematocysts. The dynamic properties of discharging nematocysts were consistent with physical results described in studies using scanning electron microscopy images of nematocyst??prey interactions. These data suggest that nematocysts vary significantly in their roles during predation, but that inferences relating prey selection with broad nematocyst categories merit careful examination.",non-battery

"A critical issue to boost the development of sodium ion batteries is the development of advanced active materials via meticulous understanding of the synthesis process. The practical application of sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3), which shows high energy density, stable structure and excellent thermal properties, is hindered by the intrinsic poor electronic conductivity. Carbon coating was proved to be an effective strategy to cover such pristine limitation and deserved systematic and intensive investigation. Herein, saccharides that widely distributed in nature with different molecular weights were selected to identify the function mechanism of carbon sources in preparing Na3V2(PO4)3@C composite via solid state reaction. Comprehensive and systematic results evidenced that the high polymer starch with glucose polymerization could construct three-dimensional interconnected carbon network, which would boost the electron conductivity and stabilize the structure upon repeated sodium ions insertion/extraction.

"Harvesting energy from ambient vibration sources with ultrathin flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) for battery-free electronics has received attention in recent years. However, the excitation modes in the environment and human body motion are more complicated than the ideal harmonic modes employed in previous theoretical analyses, and their influence on the efficiency of PEHs has received little attention. In this study, these environmental excitation modes are classified into three types, i.e., the triangular, sinusoidal, and square wave modes, with varied duty ratios. We derived theoretically the output power of flexible PEHs under these excitation modes and establish a simple scaling law, in which the normalized output power depends only on two combined normalized parameters, i.e., the intrinsic system parameter and the excitation mode. Results reveal that the output power of PEHs changes dramatically for different excitation modes with varied duty ratios even when all the other parameters including excitation amplitude, excitation frequency, electrical parameter, and geometrical and material parameters of the PEHs are identical. This paper may provide a systematic understanding in the effect of excitation modes on the output power of flexible PEHs and promote the realization of energy harvesting from the complex environmental and human body motions.

"Traditional sodium-ion battery cathodes utilize the change in oxidation state of the transition metal(s) in the structure to accommodate the electron transfer during charge and discharge. Recent researches on sodium-rich compounds such as Na2RuO3 and Na2IrO3 suggest that anionic reaction with oxygen can be an additional source of electrons during electrochemical reactions. Here we demonstrate for the first time that stoichiometric NaVO3, despite the valence of vanadium of 5+, delivers a reversible capacity by activating it beyond 4.5 V. Elemental analysis confirms Na removal and insertion from/into NaVO3 during charge/discharge. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy results show that the oxidation state of vanadium remains unchanged, while oxygen is likely to compensate for the charge transfer during charge/discharge.

"Mathematical modeling and simulation methods are important tools in studying various processes in science and engineering. In the current review, we focus on the applications of hybrid models (HMs) in chemical processes, oil and gas processes, and applied energy systems. These processes suffer from complexities that demand advanced mathematical tools to be employed for various purposes such as process development, identification, simulation and modeling, optimization, control, classification, clustering, forecasting, and monitoring. Beside the lack of adequate knowledge about the processes related to the chemical and energy systems, there are other mathematical complexities such as non-linearity, large and multi-scale, long dynamics, uncertainties, and high dimensionality. The HMs can provide a practical solution to such complex processes. The arrangements of different black-box models with themselves or with white-box models are alternatively used to reduce the model complexities. The hybrid gray-box models are of significant importance as they combine the physical significance and generalization capabilities of the white-box models with the complexity reduction capability of the black-box models to facilitate/enhance the modeling strategy, while a desired precision is targeted. Such a hybridized model enables the physically-meaningful computation for the time-demanding applications. In this paper, we review different sub-models, hybridization strategies, structural designs, screening criteria, and new directions in hybrid modeling, with focus on the corresponding applications in chemical, petroleum, and energy systems.",battery
"Results of theoretical and experimental studies of corrosion processes of graphite in vanadium electrolytes and methods for corrosion prevention are presented. Electric contact of positive half-cell electrolyte in the inlet/outlet channels of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) with graphite collectors generates parasitic electric currents, which cause electrochemical oxidation of carbon atoms on the surface of the collectors. This leads to damaging the collectors and flow battery failure. The parasitic currents in the electrolyte channels were calculated and measured. Methods to prevent the corrosion, caused by the parasitic currents, were investigated: the graphite planar collectors were electrically isolated from electrolyte in inlet/outlet channels by o-rings and in inlet/outlet area of half-cell by isolation films. A corrosion resistant battery with collectors, fabricated from pyrolytic graphite, was constructed.",battery
"Cyclic voltammograms, current transients at constant potential and potential decay transients have been used to study the formation of lead dioxide surface films in the presence of cobalt ions and their role in decreasing the oxidation rate of a lead alloy under steady state conditions typical of copper electrowinning. The observations in the present work indicate, consistent with the surface film model, that the formation of a continuous PbSO4??+????-PbO2 film on the surface of the lead alloy in the presence of cobalt ions hinders further oxidation of the metal. The protectiveness of the film is dynamic in the steady state; the film is continuously forming and dissolving. Also studied was the potential of the oxygen evolution reaction on ??-PbO2 and ??-PbO2 in 170??g??L???1 H2SO4 with and without cobalt ions. The steady state potential for oxygen evolution on ??-PbO2 in 170??g??L???1 H2SO4 at 285??A??m???2 decreased in the presence of cobalt ions and the steady state potential of ??-PbO2 was essentially the same as that of (i) the Pb??Ca??Sn alloy and (ii) ??-PbO2. The implication is that the potential of the Pb??Ca??Sn alloy is determined by the ??-PbO2 and/or ??-PbO2 on its surface.",battery
"Core??shell nanocatalysts have demonstrated potential as highly active low-Pt fuel cell cathodes for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); however, challenges remain in optimizing their surface and interfacial structures, which often exhibit undesirable structural degradation and poor durability. Here, we construct an unsupported nanoporous catalyst with a Pt??Pd shell of sub-nanometre thickness on Au, which demonstrates an initial ORR activity of 1.140??A??mgPt???1 at 0.9??V. The activity increases to 1.471??A??mgPt???1 after 30,000 potential cycles and is stable over a further 70,000 cycles. Using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and atomically resolved elemental mapping, the origin of the activity change is revealed to be an atomic-scale evolution of the shell from an initial Pt??Pd alloy into a bilayer structure with a Pt-rich trimetallic surface, and finally into a uniform and stable Pt??Pd??Au alloy. This Pt??Pd??Au alloy possesses a suitable configuration for ORR, giving a relatively low free energy change for the final water formation from adsorbed OH intermediate during the reaction.",battery
"Lead dioxide electrodes with three-dimensional porous titanium as substrate (3D-Ti/PbO2) were prepared by galvanostatic electrodeposition. The structure, morphology and electrochemical performances of 3D-Ti/PbO2 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The electrochemical performances of 3D-Ti/PbO2 were optimized by adjusting the applied deposition current density. Results reveal that the 3D-Ti/PbO2 prepared at 1mAcm???2 had nanoparticles on its surface with abundant crystal orientations. It had a high capacity of 132 mAh g???1 with an active material utilization of 57% at discharge current density of 0.9 A g???1. With the same condition, the lead dioxide electrode with planar titanium substrate (Ti/PbO2) only had a capacity of 20.8 mAh g???1. The high electrochemical active surface area and small charge transfer resistance resulted in the high capacity of 3D-Ti/PbO2. The possible factors, which affected the electrochemical performances of 3D-Ti/PbO2, were interpreted in detail with voltammetric charge analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",battery
"We have developed an efficient method to generate highly active Pd nanoparticles supported on graphene (Pd/G) by microwave-assisted chemical reduction of the corresponding aqueous mixture of a palladium salt and dispersed graphite oxide (GO) sheets. The Pd/G demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for the carbon??carbon cross-coupling reactions (Suzuki, and Heck) with a broad range of utility under ligand-free ambient conditions in an environmentally friendly solvent system. It also offers a remarkable turnover frequency (108,000h???1) observed in the microwave-assisted Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with easy removal from the reaction mixture, recyclability with no loss of activity, and significantly better performance than the well-known commercial Pd/C catalyst. The catalyst was fully characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, TGA, electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The remarkable reactivity of the Pd/G catalyst toward Suzuki cross-coupling reactions is attributed to the high degree of the dispersion and concentration of Pd(0) nanoparticles supported on graphene sheets with small particle size of 7??9nm due to an efficient microwave-assisted reduction method.",non-battery
"We explore the operations, balancing requirements, and costs of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council power system under a stringent greenhouse gas emission reduction target. We include sensitivities for technology costs and availability, fuel prices and emissions, and demand profile. Meeting an emissions target of 85% below 1990 levels is feasible across a range of assumptions, but the cost of achieving the goal and the technology mix are uncertain. Deployment of solar photovoltaics is the main driver of storage deployment: the diurnal periodicity of solar energy availability results in opportunities for daily arbitrage that storage technologies with several hours of duration are well suited to provide. Wind output exhibits seasonal variations and requires storage with a large energy subcomponent to avoid curtailment. The combination of low-cost solar technology and advanced battery technology can provide substantial savings through 2050, greatly mitigating the cost of climate change mitigation. Policy goals for storage deployment should be based on the function storage will play on the grid and therefore incorporate both the power rating and duration of the storage system. These goals should be set as part of overall portfolio development, as system flexibility needs will vary with the grid mix.",battery
Functional nanofibrous polymer membranes were prepared by incorporating poly(2-aminothio phenol) (P2AT) stabilized Au NPs onto electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) nanofibers (designated as P2AT-Au NPs@PVdF-NFM).

"Limitations of standard clinical pressure transducers have hampered our ability to provide reliable measurements of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during physical activities. To overcome these limitations, a novel intravaginal transducer (IVT) capable of accurate, reliable, and continuous IAP measurements during normal activity was developed.

The IVT demonstrated an improved dynamic response when compared to a standard rectal balloon catheter. Additionally, the radially symmetric design allows for accurate measurement within non-fluid-filled tissue cavities and simple placement within the vaginal canal. This is an advantage over sensor-tipped transducers which are only reliable in fluid-filled compartments.

"Developing fast-charging protocols for Li-ion batteries is a key issue for a wider deployment of electric vehicles and portable electrical devices. In this study, fast-charging of lithium iron phosphate batteries is investigated with different protocols. High charging rates are used with an extended constant current period thanks to a higher limit voltage based on the ohmic-drop compensation principle. This study shows that a compromise has to be found between the charging time and the durability of the battery. As an example a 6C charge with 57% ohmic-drop compensation allows to reach 95% of charge in 11min and the full charge in half an hour. With this protocol, more than 1500 cycles are reached before getting below 80% of state of health.",battery
"With the rapid surge of renewable energy integrations into the electrical grid, the main questions remain; how do we manage and operate optimally these surges of fluctuating resources? However, vast optimization approaches in renewable energy applications have been widely used hitherto to aid decision-makings in mitigating the limitations of computations. This paper comprehensively reviews the generic steps of stochastic optimizations in renewable energy applications, from the modelling of the uncertainties and sampling of relevant information, respectively. Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the stochastic optimization methods are highlighted. Moreover, notable optimization methods pertaining to the steps of stochastic optimizations are highlighted. The aim of the paper is to introduce the recent advancements and notable stochastic methods and trending of the methods going into the future of renewable energy applications. Relevant future research areas are identified to support the transition of stochastic optimizations from the traditional deterministic approaches. We concluded based on the surveyed literatures that the stochastic optimization methods almost always outperform the deterministic optimization methods in terms of social, technical, and economic aspects of renewable energy systems. Thus, this review will catalyse the effort in advancing the research of stochastic optimization methods within the scopes of renewable energy applications.",battery
"Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) battery technology is one of the promising candidates for next generation energy storage systems.

"Retinoic acid mediates most of the biological actions of vitamin A. It is oxidized by CYP26A1 to 4-oxoretinoic acid, considered as an inactive catabolite of retinoic acid. However, in the light of studies reporting the presence of 4-oxoretinal or 4-oxoretinol as the predominant retinoids during morphogenesis, we analyzed the retinoid-like biological activity of these oxoretinoids in mouse skin in vivo. Topical 4-oxoretinal and 4-oxoretinol promoted significant epidermal hyperplasia and metaplasia in mouse tail. They induced a moderate response for epidermal inflammation, compared with retinal, whereas neither 4-oxoretinal nor 4-oxoretinol prevented menadione-induced epidermal lipid peroxidation, unlike retinal and retinol. As analyzed by quantitative PCR, 4-oxoretinal and 4-oxoretinol did not reproduce the significant increased expression of genes coding for keratin 4, amphiregulin, heparin-EGF and CYP26A1, that did induce retinal and retinol. However, both retinal and 4-oxoretinal significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced maturation of human dendritic cells in vitro. As analyzed in vivo and in vitro, 4-oxoretinal and 4-oxoretinol were not converted into retinoic acid. We conclude that 4-oxoretinal and 4-oxoretinol exert a moderate direct retinoid-like activity in vivo, thus confirming previous in vitro studies in amphibians showing 4-oxometabolites of vitamin A as bioactive agents rather than inactive catabolites.",non-battery
"Zn-air batteries, which are cost-effective and have high energy density, are promising energy storage devices for renewable energy and power sources for electric transportation. Nevertheless, limited charge and discharge cycles and low round-trip efficiency have long been barriers preventing the large-scale deployment of Zn-air batteries in the marketplace.

"Smart home systems are designed as platforms for connecting sensors, home appliances, and devices to exchange data and, ultimately, to provide useful services to home residents. However, such systems are vulnerable to Cybersecurity attacks that can affect the reliability and integrity of the delivered services. Sensors, planted at smart homes or equipped with smart appliances, are highly exposed to identity theft. Intruders can recognize through the understanding of the exchanged data, their locations, or knowing their associated services. Such information might make the home resident vulnerable to life attacks. Therefore, protecting sensors identities in smart home systems is of high interest in this domain. This paper introduces a novel technique that protects sensors?? identity from being recognized through cordless communication environments. Our proposed approach utilizes a three-phase technique that controls a synchronized queue among connected sensors and keeps their identity hidden from outsiders. The proposed approach preserves the linearity of time that is required to manage the protection of the home network. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on four different smart homes datasets. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis to measure how our proposed approach is affected by different environmental variables. The results indicated that the proposed approach provides a significant performance in protecting sensors identities in smart home area networks. Furthermore, during the sensitivity analysis, we found that our proposed technique??s performance is highly affected by the threshold value that defines each sensor??s time interval.

"Due to its weight and toxicity, Pb is usually not considered as possible anode for Li- and Na-ion (NIBs) batteries. Nevertheless the toxicity is related to specific applications and its recycling is more than 99% which is one of the highest recycling rates on the planet where no other power source is utilized in more applications with such sustainability. For this reason, we have investigated micrometric lead particles as electrode for NIBs in an ether-based electrolyte (1 M NaPF6 in diglyme). The cyclability, coulombic efficiency and rate capability of lead were unexpected. A high loaded lead electrode with 98%wt of Pb and only 1% of carbon additive showed i) a capacity retention of 464 mA h/g after 50 cycles with only 1.5% of capacity loss, which represents a high volumetric capacity of 5289 mA h/cm3 due to the high density of Pb and ii) a very interesting capacity retention even at high current rate (1950 mA/g).

"The role of catalysts in vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) has been studied by introducing bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles on carbon felt (CF) and graphite felt (GF). The electrocatalytic activity and VFBs performance of CF and GF before and after modification with Bi nanoparticles are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and VFB single cell charge??discharge test. The results show that CF exhibits the much higher electrocatalytic activity than GF, due to its higher amount of C??OH and quaternary nitrogen groups and more defect sites. Bi nanoparticles can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity of CF and GF, especially GF, towards V2+/V3+ redox couple in VFBs. As a result, energy efficiency of a VFB with GF electrodes can be improved significantly by modification with Bi due to the dramatically reduced electrochemical polarization. However, the energy efficiency of a VFB with CF electrodes rarely changes after introduction of Bi nanoparticles, due to the fact that dominant limitation in a VFB with CF electrodes is ohmic polarization, and the reduced charge transfer resistance is not enough to improve the performance of this VFB remarkably. Therefore, CF is a more suitable electrode material for commercialized VFBs due to its higher electrocatalytic activity and lower cost.",battery
"The paper defines the methods for maintenance of maximum density (Nmax) in respect of the freshwater crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) fingerlings (larvae/juveniles), a prospective model organism for aquaculture. The question of optimal maintenance of the fingerlings has been addressed in the present study, considering the following parameters: (1) the ratio between the total area on which the fingerlings are being grown, and the area occupied by one individual, and (2) the planting density dependence on the specific growth rate of differently aged individuals (Cw). Analysis of our results shows that the Nmax values decrease significantly with the growth of individuals (4167, 2222 and 617??ind.??m???2 for 30, 65 and 120??days old fingerlings, respectively). The values of Cw for individuals at the age of 30??days, however, do not depend on rearing density within the range of 300??1500??ind.??m???2. A linear decrease in Cw is observed in density gradient for older ages. The density at which Cw becomes equal to zero is 3553??ind.??m???2 for 65??days old fingerlings, and 1307??ind.??m???2 for the 120??days old ones. The revealed differences (with respect to growth rates and planting densities in different age groups) may presumably be caused by the influence of the specific mechanisms of an intra-populational regulation, tenable with the conditions of high densities of fingerlings.

"In a battery pack, cell-to-cell chemical variation, or the variation in operating conditions, can possibly lead to current imbalance which can accelerate pack ageing. In this paper, the Pseudo-Two-Dimensional(P2D) porous electrode model is extended to a battery pack layout, to predict the overall behaviour and the cell-to-cell variation under constant voltage charging and discharging. The algorithm used in this model offers the flexibility in extending the layout to any number of cells in a pack, which can be of different capacities, chemical characteristics and physical dimensions. The coupled electro-thermal effects such as differential cell ageing, temperature variation, porosity change and their effects on the performance of the pack, can be predicted using this modelling algorithm. The pack charging voltage is found to have an impact on the performance as well as the SEI layer growth. Numerical studies are conducted by keeping the cells at different thermal conditions and the results show the necessity to increase the heat transfer coefficient to cool the pack, compared to single cell. The results show that the thermal imbalance has more impact than the change in inter-connecting resistance on the split current distribution, which accelerates the irreversible porous filling and ageing.",battery
"Hurricanes can pose a greater threat for small islands if larger and more frequent storms are the future reality due to climate change. Apart from property damage, hurricanes can damage natural coastal communities and wash solid waste into coastal waters and wetlands. Our goal was to develop a rapid, synoptic survey method to evaluate what happens to the coasts of small islands after hurricanes. This study reports on the development of a hurricane rapid ecological assessment method (H-REA) that was carried out on small islands in collaboration with local communities. The H-REA focused on property damage, vegetation damage, flooding, coastal erosion, and solid waste accumulation in the coastal environment. The H-REA method was developed to evaluate the hurricane damage from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and then applied to assess Hurricane Irma??s damage to both the built and natural environments in 2017. The H-REA proved to be an important tool for the rapid assessment of 2017 hurricane impacts on the southern Bahamian islands; results are shown for Great Exuma. The H-REA results highlighted the variability of damage across the islands as well as the value of coastal set-backs and protected coastal wetlands in reducing both property damage and the amount of solid waste, including plastics, entering the coastal oceans. A spatial database was established to visualize the patterns of building damage, flooding, and vegetation loss; the spatial database allows for the assessment of damage from successive hurricanes.

"This study analyzes the effect of increased thermal conductivity in energy storage, using paraffin wax with 8% w/w of aluminum foils, obtained from waste materials. Three configurations previously not published of the aluminum foil were tested: stripes, horizontal perforated disks and vertical perforated foils. The aluminum foils doubled the thermal conductivity, achieving values of 0.63 W/mK, without significant statistical influence of the metallic configuration inside this material. Solidification time depended on the configuration of the aluminum foils, where differences of up to 38% were detected between horizontal perforated disks and stripes. The equations for the solidification process were numerically solved in Matlab using the finite volume method, finding good agreement for the simulated output air temperature when compared with experimental values (relative error <10 %). Later, a thermal energy accumulator was designed and assessed, which consisted of 12 cans with paraffin wax, using the horizontal perforated disks configuration.

"This paper proposes a new control and power management strategy for a grid-connected microgrid, which includes a hybrid renewable energy sources (HRES) system and a three-phase load. The HRES system consists of a photovoltaic (PV), a battery storage system (BSS), a super-capacitor (SC) and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The dynamic model of each of these units is described. The PV is the main energy source, while the SC and the BSS due to their various power densities are considered to provide a steady and transient load demand, respectively. For increasing the reliability of the system, SOFC source is selected to keep the BSS completely charged. All these units with different DC-DC converters are connected in parallel to a common DC bus. Then, a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) is employed to convert the DC voltage to AC. To maintain the power balance and appropriate load-sharing, an adaptive fractional fuzzy sliding mode control (AFFSMC) strategy for VSI-based HRES system is presented. The controller is able to track the pre-defined instruction precisely and quickly in the microgrid. For stable performance of the control strategy under load variation, a fractional order-based sliding surface is considered. Moreover, fractional adaptive rules-based fuzzy sets are employed to accurately estimate the uncertain parameters in the microgrid. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and capability of an AFFSMC strategy under various faults and different loading conditions. Moreover, the proposed control strategy is compared with the conventional PI controller.",non-battery

"Variability and intermittency are some of the main features that characterize renewable energy sources. Intermittency usually includes both predictable and unpredictable variations. The many drawbacks of intermittency of renewable sources can be overcome by considering some special design considerations. Integrating more than one renewable energy source and including backup sources and storage systems are among the few measures to overcome these drawbacks. These additional design considerations usually increase the overall cost of the renewable system. Furthermore, the presence of more than one energy supply/storage system requires the control of energy flow among the various sources. Therefore, optimizing the size of the components and adopting an energy management strategy (EMS) are essential to decreasing the cost of the system and limiting its negative effects. The energy management strategy is commonly integrated with optimization to ensure the continuity of load supply and to decrease the cost of energy production. Therefore, energy management is a term that collects all the systematic procedures to control and minimize the quantity and the cost of energy used to provide a certain application with its requirements. The energy management strategy usually depends on the type of energy system and its components. Various approaches and techniques have been used to develop a successful energy management strategy. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the approaches proposed and used by authors of many papers is conducted.

"The effect of crowding on the identification of words was examined in normal readers and subjects with developmental dyslexia. In Experiment 1, a matching task was used. Words were presented either alone or embedded in other words. Vocal reaction times (RT) of dyslexics were slower and more sensitive to the presence of the surrounding stimuli than those of control subjects. Similar results were obtained in a control experiment using the same task for strings of symbols (isolated or crowded) instead of words. These data indicate that differences in crowding in control and dyslexic subjects arise at a pre-linguistic level. In Experiment 2, vocal RTs to word reading were measured. Two conditions putatively reducing the effect of crowding were tested: increasing inter-letter spacing and blurring. A moderate increase of inter-letter spacing produced faster vocal RTs in dyslexics, while no effect was present in normal controls. Moderate blurring of stimuli did not change dyslexics' RTs, while normal readers became slower. Group and individual results are discussed to evaluate the extent to which crowding contributes to the genesis of developmental dyslexia.",non-battery
"Developmental dyslexia is the most common learning disability in school-aged children with an estimated incidence of five to ten percent. The cause and pathophysiological substrate of this developmental disorder is unclear. Recently, a possible involvement of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of dyslexia has been postulated. In this study, 15 dyslexic children and 7 age-matched control subjects were investigated by means of functional neuroimaging (fMRI) using a noun-verb association paradigm. Comparison of activation patterns between dyslexic and control subjects revealed distinct and significant differences in cerebral and cerebellar activation. Control subjects showed bilaterally well-defined and focal activation patterns in the frontal and parietal lobes and the posterior regions of the cerebellar hemispheres. The dyslexic children, however, presented widespread and diffuse activations on the cerebral and cerebellar level. Cerebral activations were found in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Activations in the cerebellum were found predominantly in the cerebellar cortex, including Crus I, Crus II, hemispheric lobule VI, VII and vermal lobules I, II, III, IV and VII. This preliminary study is the first to reveal a significant difference in cerebellar functioning between dyslexic children and controls during a semantic association task. As a result, we propose a new hypothesis regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms of developmental dyslexia. Given the sites of activation in the cerebellum in the dyslexic group, a defect of the intra-cerebellar distribution of activity is suspected, suggesting a disorder of the processing or transfer of information within the cerebellar cortex.",non-battery

Nevertheless, the cell design separates the functions of transient voltammetry and SR-GIXRD measurements, viz., voltammetry is performed at high flow rates with a substantially distended window to minimize the IR (Ohmic) drop of the electrolyte, while SR-GIXRD is undertaken using stop-flow conditions with a very thin layer of electrolyte to minimize X-ray absorption and scattering by the solution.",battery
"As the lightest and most electropositive material, lithium metal is regarded as the ultimate anode material for next-generation high-energy batteries. However, uncontrolled dendritic lithium growth as well as low Coulombic efficiency hinders its widespread application in secondary batteries. Interfacial modification of anodes with protective layers has been proved to be an effective way to inhibit the growth of ramified lithium. Here we report on a freestanding, highly flexible nanostructured carbon film, which is ready to be transferred onto electrodes with great ease. We show that such mechanically robust carbon films can effectively suppress the growth of Li dendrites upon cycling at practical current densities (0.25??1.0mAcm???2) with significantly improved Coulombic efficiency up to ~99.5% for over hundreds of cycles and thousands of operation hours. Notably, this semi-tubular carbon film demonstrated instant, reliable protection to electrodes in not only reactive electrolytes but also ambient environment with high humidity, offering a practically feasible route toward the dendrite-free lithium metal batteries.",battery
"Disordered surface of anode materials accompanied by oxygen vacancies, has been developed as an efficient strategy to promote their charge-transfer kinetics and then improve their electrochemical properties. It is rarely explored for cathode materials before. Here, LiTi2-x Mn x (PO4-y )3 nanoparticles with a disordered surface and oxygen vacancies, are synthesized by a hydrothermal method following with an annealing in Ar/H2. Their disordered surface and heteroatom doping by reduced Mn/Ti species, have been supported by HRTEM images, XPS and EDS spectra. After 120 cycles at 0.2 C, these nanoparticles still deliver a capacity of 127 mAh g???1, much higher than the product without any doping, and that without a disordered surface. Even after 500 cycles, the capacity is still at 101 mAh g???1 for 5 C or at 71 mAh g???1 for 20 C. These results could be attributed to the reduced charge-transfer resistance caused by disordered surface, and the enhanced lithium-diffusion induced by doping.",battery
"H2V3O8 nanobelts have been successfully synthesised from commercial V2O5 powder through a fast and environmental friendly microwave-hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and ICP spectroscopy were used to characterise the morphology and structure??microstructure details. Nanobelts about 100 nm wide and several micrometres long are easily prepared in no more than 2 h. The electrochemical study reveals the reversible insertion of ca. 4 Li per formula unit (400 mAh g???1), through several pseudo-plateaus in the 3.75??1.5 V vs Li+/Li voltage range showing the interest of this material produced by a ??green?? route as an electrode for lithium rechargeable batteries. After the first cycle a significant capacity loss is observed, though a high capacity, ca. 300 mAh g???1, remains upon cycling. Furthermore, the similarity of discharge and charge curves, pointing to the absence of hydrogen displacement during lithium insertion in H2V3O8, shows that not all protonated systems must be discarded as prospective electrode materials. On the other hand, further reduction down to 1 V is possible to insert up to 5 Li per formula unit (480 mAh g???1). Interestingly it corresponds to full reduction of vanadium to V3+ as it is also confirmed by EELS experiments. However, the full reduction to V3+ is associated with a fast decay of the extra capacity developed at low voltage with increasing current rate. Then for practical use we may consider only the capacity obtained down to 1.5 V.",battery

"We report the characterization of a redox polyelectrolyte based on ferrocenated imidazolium and imidazole repeating units to evaluate the impact of the charged structure on the electron transfer rates. N-vinyl-N??-(methylferrocene)imidazolium chloride monomer was polymerized in the presence of various amounts of vinylimidazole to obtain the electroactive heteropolymer, as the homopolymerization was unsuccessful due to electrostatic repulsion between the imidazolium monomers. NMR was used to determine the ratio of electroactive to neutral monomers in the polymer. The electrochemistry of a thin film of the polymer casted on the surface of glassy carbon electrode was studied in 1 M NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry at low scan rates (i.e. ?? < 0.1 V s???1) showed a response close to the expected behavior for a surface-confined process without any significant interactions between the ferrocene redox centers, in contrast with poly(vinylferrocene). At high scan rates (?? > 1 V s???1); the behavior was diffusion-controlled. The diffusion coefficient of the ferrocene centers in the imidazolium polymer is 1.7 ?? 10???9 cm2 s???1 which is one order of magnitude higher than poly(vinylferrocene), and the standard rate constant, determined by the Nicholson's approach, was k0 = 3.8 ?? 10???4 cm s???1. These high values are explained by favorable interactions of the electrolyte with the charged imidazolium, providing a fast ion diffusion and pairing with ferrocenium. The potential use of this redox polymer in electrochemical systems is demonstrated via the formation of a composite with electrochemically exfoliated graphite to increase polymer loading.",battery
"Background Previous studies indicate that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with anode over motor cortex (M1) and cathode over contralateral supraorbital region (SO) may be effective in reducing pain, but these studies are limited in number and have not focused on older adults with osteoarthritis (OA). Objective To evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of M1-SO applied tDCS on clinical pain severity and mobility performance in adults with knee OA pain. Methods Forty 50- to 70-year-old community-dwelling participants with knee OA were randomly assigned to receive five daily sessions of 2 mA tDCS for 20 min (n = 20) or sham tDCS (n = 20). We measured clinical pain severity via Numeric Rating Scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. In addition, we measured mobility performance using the 6-Minute Walk Test and the Short Physical Performance Battery. Moreover, we obtained a sensation/safety questionnaire and measured cognition changes using the PROMIS-Applied Cognition-Abilities-Short Form 8a. Results Active tDCS over M1-SO significantly reduced Numeric Rating Scale of pain compared to sham tDCS after completion of the five daily sessions, and remained up to three weeks. No other measures were significantly different from sham. Participants tolerated tDCS over M1-SO well without serious adverse effects or cognition changes. Conclusion Although not consistent in all pain measurements, our findings demonstrate promising clinical efficacy for reduction in pain perception for older adults with knee OA.

" Porous graphitic carbon materials (PGCs) with a microtubular structure were synthesized by a simple method simultaneously completing graphitization and activation for the mixture of willow catkins, KCl, and different ferric salts. The introduction of KCl was crucial to develop a porous structure. KCl, replacing corrosive KOH or poisonous ZnCl2, greatly decreased the cost for production of PGCs. The resulting material PGCN, which was produced by willow catkins, KCl, and Fe(NO3)3, not only inherited the natural microtubular morphology of willow catkins but also possessed a high graphitization degree and abundant porosity. As such, PGCN could serve as an ideal substrate for MnO2 deposition to alleviate its accumulation and improve its conductivity. The obtained PGCN/MnO2 composite electrode significantly enhanced high specific capacitance 571.1??F g?????1 at 2??A g?????1 based on the mass of MnO2. Even at a high current density of 50??A g?????1, specific capacitance still reached 382.1??F g?????1. Furthermore, the electrode exhibited outstanding cycling stability with only 14.8% degradation after 3000 cycles.

"Background/purpose Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for adults and children with drug-resistant epilepsy and is able to improve most types of epilepsy. The aim of this study, in a paediatric population, was to assess the overall efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation on seizures, to assess tolerability and quality of life. Methods This single-centre, retrospective study reviewed the files of 29 children in whom a vagus nerve stimulator was implanted between 1995 and 2012. The response rate (greater than 50% reduction of the seizure frequency), antiepileptic efficacy according to the type of epilepsy or age at implantation or age at onset of epilepsy, the time-course of seizures, adverse effects, overall quality of life and number of hospitalisations were studied. Results In our population, vagus nerve stimulation achieved a significant reduction in the seizure frequency throughout follow-up (p = 0.015). Response rates were 59% at 3 months, and 66% at 6 months, and the response rate then remained stable at about 70%. Stimulation tended to be more effective in patients with non-idiopathic partial epilepsy than in patients with non-idiopathic and idiopathic generalised epilepsy (0.01 < p < 0.11). No other predictive factors of efficacy were identified. Patients, parents, caregivers reported improvement in overall quality of life in 38% of patients during clinical interviews. A significant reduction in the number of hospitalisations due to a reduction of seizure frequency was observed after implantation (p = 0.03). VNS was stopped because of complications or insufficient efficacy in 9 cases. Conclusion Vagus nerve stimulation is a safe and effective treatment option in children with drug-resistant epilepsy who are not candidates for surgery.",non-battery
"This paper reviews the current status of soft robots in biomedical field. Soft robots are made of materials that have comparable modulus of elasticity to that of biological systems. Several advantages of soft robots over rigid robots are safe human interaction, ease of adaptation with wearable electronics and simpler gripping. We review design factors of soft robots including modeling, controls, actuation, fabrication and application, as well as their limitations and future work. For modeling, we survey kinematic, multibody and numerical finite element methods. Finite element methods are better suited for the analysis of soft robots, since they can accurately model nonlinearities in geometry and materials. However, their real-time integration with controls is challenging. We categorize the controls of soft robots as model-based and model-free. Model-free controllers do not rely on an explicit analytical or numerical model of the soft robot to perform actuation. Actuation is the ability to exert a force using actuators such as shape memory alloys, fluid gels, elastomers and piezoelectrics. Nonlinear geometry and materials of soft robots restrict using conventional rigid body controls. The fabrication techniques used for soft robots differ significantly from that of rigid robots. We survey a wide range of techniques used for fabrication of soft robots from simple molding to more advanced additive manufacturing methods such as 3D printing. We discuss the applications and limitations of biomedical soft robots covering aspects such as functionality, ease of use and cost. The paper concludes with the future discoveries in the emerging field of soft robots.

"This paper presents a detailed analysis of the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for different electricity storage technologies. Costs were analyzed for a long-term storage system (100MW power and 70GWh capacity) and a short-term storage system (100MW power and 400MWh capacity). Detailed data sets for the latest costs of four technology groups are provided in this paper. The LCOS method allows a cost comparison of technologies in different system designs and various operation modes. The results for the long-term storage show that Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity has the lowest LCOS among the mature technologies today. Power to Gas technologies, once established on the market, may also provide long-term electricity storage at even lower LCOS. Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity is also the cheapest technology for short-term storage systems. Battery systems at the moment still have high costs but are expected to have a sharp price decrease in the near future. Power to Gas and adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage systems may become cost competitive as short-term storage systems as well. The detailed analysis of the cost components shows that the cost composition is very inhomogeneous among the technologies. Plant design optimized to the application is therefore crucial for cost minimization. Sensitivity analysis shows that for most technologies the amount of energy discharged as well as the cost of electricity purchase are the most influential factors for the LCOS.",battery
"Currently it is very difficult for connection oriented applications to use a mobile environment. One reason is that Mobile IP requires intermediate software agents to be deployed in the Internet. This infrastructure based mobility scheme offers connectivity to itinerant hosts but incurs significant handoff and tunneling delays along with deployment costs. These delays are particularly harmful for connection oriented applications. In this paper we investigate an alternate mobility scheme which does not require any such infrastructure but only uses an end-point technique and interestingly provides much faster loss-free handoff for connection oriented applications. This End-to-End scheme named Interactive Protocol for Mobile Networks (IPMN) intelligently performs handoff based on information provided by MAC Layer. The network address change is handled by renewing the existing connections by manipulating the TCP/IP stack at the end-points. Also, unlike several other recently proposed end-to-end techniques which require extensive modification of end-protocols, the proposed scheme does not require any functional change in the TCP/IP protocol software. Besides the difference in deployment scenarios, the IPMN offers blazingly fast event based handoff and much faster and simplified transport (no tunneling delay) than MIP. We have implemented IPMN over FreeBSD. In this paper we show the performance advantage of IPMN over MIP with real deployment for three interesting real-time traffic types ?? www, voice streaming and, steerable/interactive time critical video.",non-battery

"Ionic liquid electrolytes containing a certain amount of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI) anion can provide reversible capacity for a graphitized negative electrode without any additives such as a solvent. Cyclic voltammetry for a graphitized negative electrode in ionic liquid electrolytes containing FSI with other anions suggests that the reversibility of Li intercalation correlates with the relative quantity (or concentration) of FSI in the electrolytes, and that the correlative tendency depends on the other kind of anion. On the basis of the present results, we discuss the effect of FSI in the ionic systems on a graphitized electrode interface.",battery
"Corrosive (caustic) material ingestion remains a major health issue, particularly in developing countries. The management strategy after corrosive ingestion should be planned according to the signs and symptoms. The management of corrosive ingestion based on endoscopic grading, nothing by mouth, and barium studies should be abandoned. With the new management protocol, esophageal stricture can be predicted with high accuracy using the simple new prognostic DROOL score (?????4) rather than endoscopic grading, reduced by immediate oral feeding as soon as the patient can swallow saliva instead of nothing by mouth, diagnosed earlier (10??14??days) by fluoro-endoscopic balloon-assisted esophageal examination for patients with persistent dysphagia instead of relying on a barium study (?????21??days), and adequately treated by initiating balloon dilation earlier during the same anesthesia procedure. Fluoroscopically guided balloon dilatation with large balloons (18??20??mm) seems to be safe, with a low frequency of complications and a high success rate. If dilatation fails after a few months, esophagectomy and replacement surgery using the stomach should be considered. The increased risk of developing esophageal carcinoma after ingestion of corrosive substances should be kept in mind.

"An analytical model is developed for the discharge voltage of Li??air batteries with mixed organic/aqueous electrolyte and used to analyze the effects of the oxygen dissolution, solubility, pressure, and diffusivity, reaction rates, and internal resistance on the power density of Li??air batteries. By carefully identifying the model parameters using experimental data it is shown that, for discharge currents above 25 mA cm???2 the power of these batteries is mainly limited by the large internal resistance of the membrane and membrane/electrolyte interfaces (which is currently larger than 100 ?? cm2), while for smaller discharge currents the power is limited by the low oxygen concentration at the reaction sites. The maximum power density can be increased by approximately 1.5 times if the internal resistance is decreased from 100 ?? cm2 to 25 ?? cm2. This relatively small increase in the power density is due to the low dissolution rate and solubility of the oxygen in the liquid electrolyte. Finally, when the battery is operated at maximum discharge power, the oxygen diffusion length in the aqueous electrolyte is under 1 ??m, which shows that one needs to use partly wet cathodes in order to achieve high power densities in these batteries.",battery
"A new approach has been developed for the preparation of anodes for rechargeable Li batteries based on nanoparticles of tin as an alloying medium embedded in microporous (pore diameter, <2nm) carbon matrices. It is assumed that if tin particles are confined within the carbon micropores, they may exhibit better cyclability upon alloying??dealloying with lithium, since the detrimental effect of the volume expansion of Li x Sn upon alloying can be avoided. A volatile compound of tin, SnCl4, was physisorbed to the carbon surface. This was followed by hydrolysis to SnO2 and by high temperature degassing, which completed the hydrolysis and removed any volatile residue. Using SEM, EDAX and XRD analyses, we could show that we indeed obtained porous carbon, with particles of tin oxide within the microporous system. These matrices were tested as negative electrodes for secondary Li batteries. At this early stage of the study, a reversible capacity as high as 305mAhg???1 was obtained (carbon and Sn), which means that the capacity of the Li??tin alloying was not to far from its theoretical value. The next steps in this study are: 1. Increasing the amount of tin that can be included in the carbon matrices. 2. The development of the preceding reduction process of SnO2 to Sn, which will reduce pronouncedly the initial irreversible capacity.",battery
"To explore the surface state of electrocatalysts, herein we developed a surface laser modification (pulsed laser ablation, PLA) approach for the fabrication of NiCo2O4-?? with substantial inner oxygen vacancies (Vo ???? ) and higher exterior Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio. The separated NiCo2O4 nanoplates were transformed to cross-linked NiCo2O4-?? nanostructure through PLA strategy. As compare with the primordial NiCo2O4 produce, the laser-modificated NiCo2O4-?? exhibits higher capacitance, lower overpotential and better electrocatalytic performance. The first-principles calculation proves that the additional energy level is introduced between the valence band and conduction band of L-NiCo2O4-??. The additional energy level not only benefits the hopping of electrons, but also inhibits the recombination of electron-hole pairs. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) confirms that the active sites of the electrocatalytic reaction are Vo ???? , suggesting that the electron structure of catalyst could be adjusted by PLA. The high electrocatalytic activity of laser-modificated NiCo2O4-?? could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of increased number of inner Vo ???? , higher electrochemically active surface area, and dominated Nioct.

"Lithium-rich layered oxides have being regarded as one of the most promising cathodes for next generation high energy density lithium ion batteries due to their extremely high capacity beyond 250mAhg???1. Among which, Ru-based lithium-rich layered oxides attract special research interests recently for their relatively low irreversible capacity loss during initial cycle and good rate performance. However, as a typical Ru-based lithium-rich layered oxides, Li2RuO3 suffers severely from poor cycling stability and huge voltage decay upon prolonged cycling. Here, we propose a mono-valence cationic substitution strategy of Na+ ions into Li2RuO3 lattice to form Li2-xNaxRuO3 (x=0, 0.02, 0.06, 0.1) series and systematically investigate their electrochemical properties.

Cyclic voltammograms of the lead??antimony alloy electrodes, similarly to pure lead electrode, also show the ??anodic excursion?? peak under some experimental conditions. Well defined current waves, corresponding to the oxidation and reduction processes of Sb, are observed, if the alloy surface is freshly abraded.

Our ability to synthesize and study these 2D materials down to a single layer and to stack them to form van der Waals heterostructures opens up a wide range of possibilities from fundamental studies of nanoscale effects to future electronic and optoelectronic applications. Bottom-up and top-down synthesis and basic electronic properties of 2D chalcogenide materials have been covered in great detail elsewhere. Here, we bring attention to more subtle effects: how the environmental, surface, and crystal defects modify the electronic band structure and transport properties of 2D chalcogenide nanomaterials.

Thus, understanding such effects is critical for successful applications based on these materials. In this review, we discuss two classes of chalcogenides ?? Bi-based and Mo-based chalcogenides. The first are topological insulators with unique surface electronic properties and the second are promising for flexible optoelectronic applications as well as hydrogen evolution catalytic reactions.

The Sn-SnO2 heterojunction is built by depositing of metallic Sn on crystal lattice oxygen of as-formed SnO2, which obviously increase the amount of adsorbed oxygen on the surface of catalyst. The as-synthesized catalysts display higher photocatalytic activity than SnO2 and SnO2/C for degradation of reactive brilliant blue KN-R under visible light irradiation. The enhancement of photocatalytic performance of Sn-SnO2/C can be attributed to the formation of metallic Sn on the surface of catalysts. The metallic Sn and adsorbed oxygen as the sinks of photoinduced electron and electronic scavenges, respectively, hinder the recombination of photoexcitated electron-hole pairs, sequentially enhance the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, a possible growth mechanism of the Sn-SnO2/C photocatalysts was proposed.

"The kinetics of Li-ion deintercalation in Li1.12[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]0.89O2 samples is studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) during the first charge process. The impedance response of Li1.12[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]0.89O2 largely depends on the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the cell, showing that the mechanism of electrode kinetics under different potentials is dominated by different electro-chemical reactions. Meanwhile, the equivalent circuit is proposed to simulate the EIS data, deducing the circuit elements (R i and C i) which are normally modeled as a multistep process of electro-chemical reactions. The change trend of R sf (the resistance of SEI film) and R ct (the charge-transfer resistance) in the first charge process are exactly similar. The C dl (double-layer capacitance) as a function of voltage gradually increases, particularly after 4.5V. The maximum of C sf (the film capacitor) observed in the first charge process shows that the most intensive ionic fluxes will appear when the Li1.12[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]0.89O2 electrode reach to the transient equilibrium at different levels of deintercalation. To study the faster capacity fading of Li1.12[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]0.89O2 during the first charge process, the Li-ion diffusion coefficient (D Li) is also calculated based on the results of EIS and GITT.",battery
"Thin films of LiCoO2 with a preferred c-axis orientation were prepared by pulsed laser deposition. Thin films deposited for 1??2h had a preferred c-axis orientation, but films deposited for 3h and longer lost the preferred orientation. The textures of these films were investigated in detail by transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. The electrochemical properties of these films were compared by cyclic voltammetry and alternating current impedance spectroscopy. In the cyclic voltammograms of the c-axis oriented films, the anodic and cathodic peaks corresponding to the first-order phase transition at around 3.9V were sharp and their peak separation was small due to their thin and uniform texture. However, their smooth surface and texture of the aligned (003) planes gave a larger charge-transfer resistance and a smaller apparent diffusion coefficient in the direction normal to the substrate, respectively, which resulted in poor utilizations (???50%) of the active material. The reactivity in the single-phase region at potentials more positive than 4.0V was lower than that of randomly oriented films.",battery

Both calix[4]arene derivatives studied have identical anion coordination groups but they have different compatibility with the polymer matrix obtained by chemical linking of the oligo(ethylene oxide) chains to one of the studied calixarenes. The impedance spectroscopy studies showed that the addition of the anion receptor significantly changes the conductivity. The character of this changes strongly depends on the receptor used while the electrochemical stability of these two calixarene receptors measured by cyclic voltammetry is similar. It was also proved that addition of the anion receptor strongly changes the polymer matrix morphology and thermal behavior. By the comparison with the liquid systems which electrical properties were similar to the polymer matrix, we can assume that these changes are a result of anion??receptor interactions.",battery

"Accumulating evidence suggests that not only diseases of old age, but also normal aging, affect elderly adults?? ability to draw on the framework theories that structure our abstract causal-explanatory knowledge, knowledge that we use to make sense of the world. One such framework theory, the cross-culturally universal vitalist biology, gives meaning to the abstract concepts life and death. Previous work shows that many elderly adults are animists, claiming that active, moving entities such as the sun and the wind are alive (Zaitchik & Solomon, 2008). Such responses are characteristic of young children, who, lacking an intuitive theory of biology, distinguish animals from non-animals on the basis of a theory of causal and intentional agency. What explains such childlike responses? Do the elderly undergo semantic degradation of their intuitive biological theory? Or do they merely have difficulty deploying their theory of biology in the face of interference from the developmentally prior agency theory? Here we develop an analytic strategy to answer this question. Using a battery of vitalist biology tasks, this study demonstrates??for the first time??that animism in the elderly is due to difficulty in deployment of the vitalist theory, not its degradation. We additionally establish some powerful downstream consequences of theory deployment difficulties, demonstrating that the elderly??s use of the agency theory is not restricted to animist judgments??rather, it pervades their explicit reasoning about animates and inanimates. Extending the investigation, we identify specific cognitive mechanisms implicated in adult animism, finding that differences between young and elderly adults are mediated and moderated by differences in inhibition and shifting mechanisms. The analytic strategy developed here could help adjudicate between degradation and deployment in other conceptual domains and other populations.",non-battery
"In this manuscript, performance of a novel concentrated solar thermal collector with evacuated tube is studied. The focus is the optimization of cost and performance in respect to commercially available medium temperature collectors (100??300 ??C) using thermal and economic index of heat generation system also known as Levelized Cost of Heat. In this project, Levelized Cost of Heat is optimized with material cost reduction while maintaining high thermal performance using economical aluminum fin (instead of copper), a glass cover and highly truncated aluminum reflector. The reflector is truncated using the nonimaging optics methods in order to maximize the optical efficiency while minimizing the material consumption. Also, in order to predict the thermal performance of the proposed collector, analytical and numerical simulation are studied. Finally, the collector is experimentally tested in three stages to measure maximum temperature, maximum efficiency and thermal efficiency at various temperature of heat transfer fluid. The mathematical, numerical and experimental results were found to have good agreement.

"This paper reports studies on the morphology, thermal stability, NMR and electrical spectroscopy of the first lithium zeolitic inorganic??organic polymer electrolyte (Z-IOPE) with the formula [Fe x Pd y (CN) z Cl v (C2n H4n+2O n+1)Li l ]. Both 1H and 7Li NMR linewidth, spin-lattice relaxation, and pulsed field gradient diffusion measurements were conducted, and the results suggest that the lithium ion transport is correlated with polymer mobility, as in the case of ??conventional?? polymer electrolytes. A detailed study of the mechanism of ion conduction in bulk material has been carried out also by electrical spectroscopy measurements in the 10 mHz??1 GHz range. The electrical spectra for frequencies higher than 15 kHz evidenced the presence of relaxation events associated to local ion motion dynamics and long range diffusion. These two phenomena were interpreted in terms of (a) ion hopping processes; (b) site relaxations; and (c) host medium reorganization processes. Taken together, these studies demonstrated that at temperatures higher than 35??C, the Z-IOPE conducts ionically by charge transfer mechanisms mainly regulated by ion hopping between equivalent polyether coordination sites followed by correlated host medium reorganizations.

"We have investigated an inorganic lithium battery system in which LiCoO2 is used as the positive electrode and lithium, intercalated into graphite, serves as negative electrode. The conducting salt is lithium tetrachloroaluminate (LiAlCl4). The electrolyte is based on SO2. It has been shown that a layer of lithium hydroxide is present on the surface of the lithium cobalt oxide. This has a negative impact on the stability of the electrode. To improve stability, we have developed a purification process for removing the lithium hydroxide from the surface of the positive electrode. After purification the cells show no significant change in either capacity or internal resistance when cycled. Up to 70% of the theoretical capacity of electrodes which have been purified in this way can be used without any negative effects being observed. To prevent the deposition of metallic lithium leading to a hazardous situation, a new safety concept was developed whereby local short circuits are allowable. Safe functioning of the new concept has been demonstrated with tests on complete cells.",battery

Although these xLi2MnO3??(1 ???x)LiMnO2 nanoplates cause a longer Li+ diffusion distance, and then a lower reversible capacity as compared to the nanoparticle-like counterpart, the nanoplate-like morphology of these xLi2MnO3??(1??? x)LiMnO2 (especially with x <0.5) are beneficial for retarding the layer-to-spinel phase transformation during the charge/discharge processes, and resulting in significant improvement of the cyclic stability. Moreover, the reduced reversible capacity caused by the longer Li+ diffusion distance of the nanoplate-like morphology can be offset by decreasing the x value, and the xLi2MnO3??(1??? x)LiMnO2 nanoplates with x =0.44 performs a maximum reversible capacity as high as 270mAhg???1 with a well cyclic performance.

"Lithium??sulfur battery is amongst the most promising next-generation energy storage technology owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density.

"Although imitation problems have been associated with autism for many years, the underlying mechanisms of these problems remain subject to debate. In this article, the question whether imitation problems are caused by selection or correspondence problems is explored and discussed. This review revealed that hypotheses on the nature of imitation problems in autism are complicated and inconclusive at the present time. There is some evidence for impaired selection, especially implicating poor preferential attention to biological motion and poor ascription of intention to action. There is also some evidence that both transformations of perspectives and mapping of visual to motor information are impaired, characterized as correspondence problems. However, it is not yet clear how poor selection processes contribute to correspondence problems and vice versa. Insight in this interaction may provide a valuable contribution to our understanding of imitation problems in autism.

"Engineering crystal facets to enhance their functionalities often require complex processing routes to suppress the growth of surfaces with the lowest thermodynamic energies. Herein, we report a unique method to control the morphologies of ??-MnO2 crystals with different occupancy of {100}/{111} facets through the effect of K+ cations. Combining aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), ultramicrotomy, and dynamic functional theory (DFT) simulation, we clarified that the ??-MnO2 crystals were formed through a direct solid-state phase transition process. Increasing the concentration of K+ cations in the precursor gradually changed the morphology of ??-MnO2 from bipyramid prism ({100}+{111} facets) to an octahedron structure ({111} facets). The K+ cations controlled the morphology of ??-MnO2 by affecting the formation of ??-K0.5Mn4O8 intermediate phase and the subsequent phase transition.

Wire-array solar cells without some or all of these design features were also fabricated to demonstrate the importance of the light-trapping elements in achieving a high Jsc. Scanning photocurrent microscopy images of the microwire-array solar cells revealed that the higher Jsc of the most advanced cell design resulted from an increased absorption of light incident in the space between the wires.

Several candidates, including Li2MnO3-stabilized LiM??O2 (M?? = Mn/Ni/Co) structures, Li2Ru0.75Sn0.25O3 (i.e., 3Li2RuO3??Li2SnO3), and disordered Li2MoO3??LiCrO2 compounds can yield capacities exceeding 200 mA h g???1, alluding to the constructive role that Li2MO3 (M4+) end-member compounds play in the electrochemistry of these systems. Here, we catalog the family of Li2MO3 compounds as active cathodes or inactive stabilizing agents using high-throughput density functional theory (HT-DFT). With an exhaustive search based on design rules that include phase stability, cell potential, resistance to oxygen evolution, and metal migration, we predict a number of new Li2MIO3??Li2MIIO3 active/inactive electrode pairs, in which MI and MII are transition- or post-transition metal ions, that can be tested experimentally for high-energy-density LIBs.

"Efforts to replace conventional chromatographic methods for environmental monitoring with cheaper and easy to use biosensors for precise detection and estimation of hazardous environmental toxicants, water or air borne pathogens as well as various other chemicals and biologics are gaining momentum. Out of the various types of biosensors classified according to their bio-recognition principle, nucleic-acid-based sensors have shown high potential in terms of cost, sensitivity, and specificity. The discovery of catalytic activities of RNA (ribozymes) and DNA (DNAzymes) which could be triggered by divalent metallic ions paved the way for their extensive use in detection of heavy metal contaminants in environment. This was followed with the invention of small oligonucleotide sequences called aptamers which can fold into specific 3D conformation under suitable conditions after binding to target molecules. Due to their high affinity, specificity, reusability, stability, and non-immunogenicity to vast array of targets like small and macromolecules from organic, inorganic, and biological origin, they can often be exploited as sensors in industrial waste management, pollution control, and environmental toxicology. Further, rational combination of the catalytic activity of DNAzymes and RNAzymes along with the sequence-specific binding ability of aptamers have given rise to the most advanced form of functional nucleic-acid-based sensors called aptazymes. Functional nucleic-acid-based sensors (FNASs) can be conjugated with fluorescent molecules, metallic nanoparticles, or quantum dots to aid in rapid detection of a variety of target molecules by target-induced structure switch (TISS) mode. Although intensive research is being carried out for further improvements of FNAs as sensors, challenges remain in integrating such bio-recognition element with advanced transduction platform to enable its use as a networked analytical system for tailor made analysis of environmental monitoring.",non-battery

These spinels are prepared by a solid-state reaction among the precursors ??-MnO2, LiOH, and the respective oxide/salt of the doping ions at 750??C for 72h and milled for 30min. The obtained spinels are characterized by XRD, SEM, and determinations of the average manganese valence n. In the charge and discharge tests, the doped spinels present outstanding initial values of the specific discharge capacity C (117??126mAhg???1), decreasing in the following order: C(Li1.05Al0.02Mn1.98S3.02O3.98)> C(Li1.05Al0.02Mn1.98F3.02O3.98)> C(Li1.05Ga0.02Mn1.98S3.02O3.98)> C(Li1.05Ga0.02Mn1.98F3.02O3.98)> C(Li1.05Co0.02Mn1.98S3.02O3.98)> C(Li1.05Co0.02Mn1.98F3.02O3.98).

"The research developments with renewable energy source water pumping systems (RESWPSs) are reviewed in this paper. The reported investigations are categorized into five major groups as follows: (i) solar photovoltaic water pumping systems (SPWPSs), (ii) solar thermal water pumping systems (STWPSs), (iii) wind energy water pumping systems (WEWPSs), (iv) biomass water pumping systems (BWPSs) and (v) hybrid renewable energy water pumping systems (HREWPSs).

"Although cognitive neuroscience has made valuable progress in understanding the role of the prefrontal cortex in human intelligence, the functional networks that support adaptive behavior and novel problem solving remain to be well characterized. Here, we studied 158 human brain lesion patients to investigate the cognitive and neural foundations of key competencies for fluid intelligence and working memory. We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the N-Back task. Latent variable modeling was applied to obtain error-free scores of fluid intelligence and working memory, followed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. The observed latent variable modeling and lesion results support an integrative framework for understanding the architecture of fluid intelligence and working memory and make specific recommendations for the interpretation and application of the WAIS and N-Back task to the study of fluid intelligence in health and disease.",non-battery

The excellent supercapacitive properties of the nanocomposite arising from both the electrical double layer capacitance of graphene nanosheets and pseudocapacitance of polyluminol resulted from a synergistic effect of the complementary properties of graphene and polyluminol.

"The challenges of providing electricity to rural households are manifold. Ever increasing demand??supply gap, crumbling electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, high cost of delivered electricity are a few of these. Use of renewable energy technologies for meeting basic energy needs of rural communities has been promoted by the Governments world over for many decades. Photovoltaic (PV) technology is one of the first among several renewable energy technologies that was adopted globally as well as in India for meeting basic electricity needs of rural areas that are not connected to the grid.

"A model-based dynamic multi-parameter method for peak power estimation is proposed for batteries and battery management systems (BMSs) used in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The available power must be accurately calculated in order to not damage the battery by over charging or over discharging or by exceeding the designed current or power limit. A model-based dynamic multi-parameter method for peak power estimation of lithium??ion batteries is proposed to calculate the reliable available power in real time, and the design limits such as cell voltage, cell current, cell SoC, cell power are all used as its constraints; more importantly, the relaxation effect also is considered. Where, to improve the model??s accuracy, the ohmic resistance of Thevenin model for the lithium??ion battery has been refined; in order to further improve the polarization parameters identification precision, a genetic algorithm has been used to gain the optimal time constant. Lastly, a test with several consecutive Federal Urban Driving Schedules (FUDSs) profiles is carried to evaluate the model-based dynamic multi-parameter method for peak power estimation. The experimental and simulation results indicate that the model-based dynamic multi-parameter method for peak power estimation can calculate the terminal voltage and the current available power much more reliably and accurately.",battery
"Cluster headache is a debilitating primary headache disorder that affects approximately 0.1% of the population worldwide. Cluster headache attacks involve severe unilateral pain in the trigeminal distribution together with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features and a sense of agitation. Acute treatments are available and are effective in just over half of the patients. Until recently, preventive medications were borrowed from non-headache indications, so management of cluster headache is challenging. However, as our understanding of cluster headache pathophysiology has evolved on the basis of key bench and neuroimaging studies, crucial neuropeptides and brain structures have been identified as emerging treatment targets. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is known about the pathophysiology of cluster headache and discuss the existing treatment options and their mechanisms of action. Existing acute treatments include triptans and high-flow oxygen, interim treatment options include corticosteroids in oral form or for greater occipital nerve block, and preventive treatments include verapamil, lithium, melatonin and topiramate. We also consider emerging treatment options, including calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation and somatostatin receptor agonists, discuss how evidence from trials of these emerging treatments provides insights into the pathophysiology of cluster headache and highlight areas for future research.",non-battery
"Mesoporous hollow TiO2 microboxes synthesized by a two-step solvothermal method via CaTiO3 intermediate were applied as host materials for sulfur cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries. 3TiO2/7S composite containing 70 wt% sulfur exhibited the best electrochemical performance among all composites. A high discharge capacity of 924.8 mAh g???1 was achieved for the 1st cycle and 67.4% of it could be retained after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Even at a higher C-rate of 1 C, more than 600 mAh g???1 of discharge capacity could be delivered after 500 cycles. The efficient polysulfide adsorption of TiO2 microboxes demonstrated by visualized adsorption test and UV??vis measurement as well as the mesoporous hollow feature was responsible for the large discharge capacity, excellent capacity retention and decent rate capability.",battery
"Vote functions are important devices for providing a ??big picture?? of developments in electoral politics. However, the limited degrees of freedom upon which they are typically based mean that vote functions are rarely able to properly discriminate between competing accounts of electoral outcomes. They also fail adequately to capture the impact of ??events?? or to recognise the extent to which the context of electoral competition can vary over time. Popularity functions that restrict themselves to relatively limited periods of time are capable of addressing all of these concerns: they enjoy more degrees of freedom, can take full account of the impact of ??events??, and can focus on very specific electoral periods. Interestingly, however, Lewis-Beck??s vote function for post-war British politics contains variables that are very similar to those in a popularity function that was developed for the most recent (2001) British general election. In the British context, vote and popularity functions seem to provide quite similar accounts of the main drivers of party support. The advantage of both approaches is that they provide clearly specified, unambiguous??and falsifiable??accounts of the phenomenon under investigation.",non-battery
"Peaking power plants are used to provide power during periods that have both high load and limited supply from intermittent renewable energy. Wind power is intermittent and does not always provide electricity during periods of maximum demand. Despite this, it has grown to produce a significant portion of the electricity in some jurisdictions. Electricity systems require firm capacity that operate when called upon. Fossil fuel peaking plants are costly, providing a fraction of the annual energy at a great cost, but ensure system reliability. Utilizing storage systems to provide these services during peak times could allow integration of higher penetrations of renewable energies. Prince Edward Island, Canada has over 40% of its load produced by wind power but requires diesel generators during high load and low wind periods. The diesel generators ensure that the submarine cables are not overloaded and provide on-island power during other curtailments. The 1 MW/2 MWh storage system provided energy and capacity from December 2015 to March 2016 and was paid for these services by their local utility. The payment only covered 9% of the costs due to the high capital cost and short life expectancy of their storage system.",battery
"Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and evolution reaction (OER) are one pair of the most important electrochemical reactions associated with energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells, metal??air batteries, and water electrolyzers. However, the sluggish ORR and OER requires a significantly large quantity of precious metals (e.g., Pt or Ir) to enhance reaction activity and durability. Highly active and robust nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) are desperately required to address the cost and durability issues. Among NPMC formulations studied, carbon-based catalysts hold the greatest promise to replace these precious metals in the future due to their low-cost, extremely high surface area, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, sufficient stability under harsh environments, and high functionality. In particular, nitrogen-doped carbon nanocomposites, which were prepared from ??metal-free?? N??C formulations and transition metals-derived M??N??C (M=Fe or Co), have demonstrated remarkably improved catalytic activity and stability in alkaline and acidic electrolytes. In this review, based on the recent progress in the field, we aim to provide an overview for both types of carbon catalysts in terms of catalyst synthesis, structure/morphology, and catalytic activity and durability enhancement. We primarily focus on elucidation of synthesis??structure??activity correlations obtained from synthesis and extensive characterization, thereby providing guidance for rational design of advanced catalysts for the ORR. Additionally, a hybrid concept of using highly ORR active carbon nanocomposites to support Pt nanoparticles was highlighted with an aim to enhance catalytic performance and reduce required precious metal loading. Beyond the ORR, opportunities and challenges of ORR/OER bifunctional carbon composite catalysts were outlined. Perspectives on these carbon-based catalysts, future approaches, and possible pathways to address current remaining challenges are also discussed.",battery
"Car manufactures have announced the launch in coming months of vehicles with reduced emissions due to the introduction of new functions like stop??start and regenerative braking. Initial performance request of automotive lead-acid batteries are becoming more and more demanding and, in addition to this, cycle life with new accelerated ageing profiles are being proposed in order to determine the influence of the new functions on the expected battery life. This paper will show how different lead-acid battery technologies comply with these new demands, from an improved version of the conventional flooded SLI battery to the high performance of spiral wound valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery. Different approaches have been studied for improving conventional flooded batteries, i.e., either by the addition of new additives for reducing electrolyte stratification or by optimisation of the battery design to extend cycling life in partial state of charge conditions. With respect to VRLA technology, two different battery designs have been compared. Spiral wound design combines excellent power capability and cycle life under different depth of discharge (DoD) cycling conditions, but flat plate design outperform the latter in energy density due to better utilization of the space available in a prismatic enclosure. This latter design is more adequate for high end class vehicles with high electrical energy demand, whereas spiral wound is better suited for high power/long life demand of commercial vehicle. High temperature behaviour (75??C) is rather poor for both designs due to water loss, and then VRLA batteries should preferably be located out of the engine compartment.",battery

"Cognitive abilities are complex human traits influenced by genetic factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a unique polypeptide growth factor, has an influence on the differentiation and survival of neurons in the nervous system. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) in the human gene, resulting in a valine to methionine substitution in the pro-BDNF protein, was thought to associate with psychiatric disorders and might play roles in the individual difference of cognitive abilities. However, the specific roles of the gene in cognition remain unclear. To investigate the relationships between the substitution and cognitive abilities, a healthy population-based study and the PCR-SSCP method were performed. The results showed the substitution was associated with digital working memory (p??=??0.02) and spatial localization (p??=??0.03), but not with inhibition, shifting, updating, visuo-spatial working memory, long-term memory, and others (p??>??0.05) among the compared genotype groups analyzed by general linear model. On the other hand, the participants with BDNFGG had higher average performance in digital working memory and spatial localization than the ones with BDNFAA. The findings of the present work implied that the variation in BDNF might play positive roles in human digital working memory and spatial localization.

"The development of novel sodium-ion batteries has been hindered by the lack of ideal anode materials. Herein, we report both experimental and theoretical assessment of layered MoSe2 nanoplates as the anode materials.

"Finding the optimal balance between electricity demand and production constrained to economic and comfort variables requires intelligent decision and control. This article addresses the formulation of three models that optimize control of a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system in an experimental room, which are coupled with two thermal models of the indoor temperature. Electricity is supplied by the grid and a photovoltaic system with batteries. The primary objective is to maximize users comfort while minimizing cost constrained to: thermal comfort; variable electricity price; and available electricity in batteries that are charged by a PV system. Three models are developed: (i) dynamic programming with simplified thermal model (STM), (ii) genetic algorithm with STM, and (iii) genetic algorithm with EnergyPlus. The genetic algorithm model that uses EnergyPlus to simulate indoor temperature generally achieves higher convergence to the optimal value, which also is the one that uses more electricity from the PV system to operate the HVAC. The dynamic programming performs better than the genetic algorithm (both coupled with STM). However, it is limited by the fact that uses STM, which is a less accurate model to simulate indoor temperature especially because it is not considering thermal inertia.",non-battery
"Cigarette smoke condensates (CSCs) are complex mixed compounds that contain both direct and indirect mutagens/carcinogens. To detect genotoxicity of CSCs in vitro, a combination of various enzymes (e.g. activation and detoxification enzymes) called S9 is usually added. However, as S9 may induce cytotoxicity in target cells, it is unclear whether the addition of S9 can impact CSC-induced toxicity. Here, differences in cytogenotoxicity between CSCs in the presence or absence of S9 were studied using three in vitro assays (neutral red uptake assay, comet assay, and TCR gene mutation test) in human peripheral lymphocytes, which were exposed to CSCs at doses of 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125??g/ml for 4h. Assay results showed that both CSCs+S9 or CSCs???S9 could induce a dose-dependent elevation of cytogenotoxic effects in human lymphocytes with some differences between the two groups. The cytogenotoxicity induced by CSCs???S9 was significantly higher than that induced by CSCs+S9 in all three assays. The comet and NRU assays revealed that a dose??response relationship of cytogenotoxicity induced by CSCs+S9 was less typical than that induced by CSCs???S9, possibly due to specific cytogenotoxic agents in CSCs and enzymes contained in the S9 mixture. Thus, the three in vitro assays used in the present study are suitable for detecting cytogenotoxic effects in human lymphocytes induced by CSCs. Furthermore, the cytogenotoxicity induced by both CSCs+S9 and CSCs???S9 should be measured simultaneously when assessing and comparing the biological activity of different CSCs.",non-battery

"There is much confusion and uncertainty in the literature concerning the useable power capability of batteries and ultracapacitors (electrochemical capacitors) for various applications. Clarification of this confusion is one of the primary objectives of this paper. The three approaches most often applied to determine the power capability of devices are (1) matched impedance power, (2) the min/max method of the USABC, and (3) the pulse energy efficiency approach used at UC Davis. It has been found that widely different power capability for batteries and ultracapacitors can be inferred using these approaches even when the resistance and open-circuit voltage are accurately known. In general, the values obtained using the energy efficiency method for EF =90??95% are much lower than the other two methods which yield values corresponding to efficiencies of 70??75%. For plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicle applications, the maximum useable power density for a lithium-ion battery can be higher than that corresponding to 95% efficiency because the peak power of the driveline is used less frequently and consequently charge/discharge efficiently is less important. For these applications, the useable power density of the batteries can be closer to the useable power density of ultracapacitors. In all cases, it is essential that a careful and appropriate measurement is made of the resistance of the devices and the comparisons of the useable power capability be made in a way appropriate for the application for which the devices are to be used.",battery
"Chlorhexidine is among the most used biocides in Europe, however its toxicity to aquatic organisms is scarcely known. The main objective of this study was to assess the lethal and sub lethal effects of chlorhexidine digluconate (ChD) on four aquatic model organisms: the bacteria Vibrio fischeri, the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the crustacean Daphnia magna and the embryos of the fish Danio rerio. ChD was very toxic to algae and crustaceans, with a 72??h-EC50 of 62.2????g/l and a 48??h-EC50 of 45.0????g/l, respectively. Toxicity to fish embryos and the bacteria was lower, with a 96??h-EC50 of 804.0????g/l and a 15??min-EC50 of 1,694.0????g/l, respectively. Concerning sub lethal effects on D. magna (feeding inhibition) a 6??h-EC50 of 503.7????g/l was obtained. In fish, ChD caused developmental abnormalities, namely alterations in the amniotic fluid (48??h-EC20 of 753.6????g/l) and early hatching. Moreover, enzymatic biomarkers on fish embryos showed an induction of cholinesterase activity in all ChD tested concentrations (80??900????g/l). The catalase activity was also induced at the highest concentration tested (900????g/l) whereas no changes were observed for glutathione-S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase activities. The toxicity of ChD to the algae and crustacean raises concerns about its potential effects in aquatic food webs, since these organisms are in the base of trophic chains, and highlights the need for further studies on ChD toxicity to aquatic organisms.

All the compounds possess the cubic spinel structure of LiMn2O4 with space group of Fd-3m. The electrochemical properties of synthesized compounds are investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

However, these isolated devices only have limited performance and/or sole applicability, and cannot provide enough energy for application with long-term run and the ever-changing working positions.

"In an endeavour to improve not only the thermal shrinkage but also the electrochemical performance of separators in lithium-ion batteries, a novel composite separator is developed, i.e., a close-packed SiO2/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) binary nanoparticles-coated polyethylene (PE) separator. The introduction of SiO2 nanoparticles to the coating layer effectively suppresses thermal shrinkage of the composite separator. In contrast to a SiO2/PMMA coating layer having a film-shaped PMMA binder, the SiO2/PMMA binary nanoparticle coating layer employs PMMA particles as a binder. As a consequence, a highly porous structure, i.e., well-connected interstitial voids, is formed between the binary SiO2 and PMMA nanoparticles. The unique porous morphology allows favourable liquid electrolyte wettability and facile ionic conduction, which play a crucial role in improving cell performance such as the discharge capacity and the C-rate capability of the composite separator.",battery

To assess the phytotoxicity of the supplements, plants were grown in three different sets; (1) Hoagland??s nutrient media [as control] (2) municipal solid waste and (3) sewage sludge soil mix. To study the phytotoxic markers, photosynthetic pigments, proline, protein content and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured and metal content of the vegetables were measured to estimate the potential dietary toxicity. It was observed from the study that vegetables grown in supplemented soils showed reduced chlorophyll and protein content while carotenoid, proline and antioxidative enzymes showed enhanced activity. In both the supplemented soil, it was observed that cadmium was present above the maximum allowable limits, amount of lead was marginal and that of chromium was below the level. It was observed that the two leafy vegetables, i.e., Lagenaria sp. and Cucurbita sp. accumulated more lead in their aerial parts, Lagenaria grown in sewage sludge supplemented soil also accumulated significant amount of cadmium in the aerial parts. Edible parts of Raphanus and maize grains also accumulated considerable amount of cadmium, which were above the value of daily tolerable limits.

"The growing concern about the environment, associated with the continuous increase in the production of electronic equipment, such as computers, cell phones, mobile devices and consequently batteries, has induced research to develop new technologies to recycle the huge numbers of spent batteries generated in the last few years. The amount of spent NiMH batteries will tend to grow continually over the next few years. These batteries have in their chemical composition, valuable metals such as Ni, Co and rare earths. In the first stage of this work a characterization of NiMH batteries was done. Batteries from different brands and models were disembled and their components were characterized in relation to their chemical composition and main phases. In a second stage of this work, a sample of spent NiMH batteries was milled and the polymeric and metallic fractions were magnetically separated. The results obtained demonstrate that the recycling study, aimed at the recovery of Ni, Co and rare earths, is viable due to the great amount of these metals that are present batteries. It also demonstrates that magnetic separation is a very efficient process to recovery nickel alloys. However the effects of cadmium contamination (originating from fake batteries) will cause the recycling processes to be re-evaluated.",battery
"Carbon aerogel, carbon black and graphite were used to analyze the influence of conductive filler on the impedance behaviors of activated carbon based electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). According to the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) data, a new equivalent circuit model was proposed involving the kinetic characteristics of ion diffusion, furthermore, Marquardt fit procedure was applied to the EIS data to obtain the model parameter values. The results indicated that carbon aerogel could significantly decrease the resistance of EDLCs by increasing the diffusion coefficient of ions within electrodes and decreasing the interface resistance because of its suitable particle size, mesoporous structures and finely-branched particle performance.",battery
"The electrochemical behavior and the electrodeposition of dysprosium (Dy) in phosphonium-cation-based ionic liquid were investigated in this study. A new group of the room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) based on phosphonium cations with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide anions was applied as novel electrolytic solutions. The cyclic voltammetric measurements resulted in one step reduction of the trivalent dysprosium ion in phosphonium-cation-based ionic liquid. On the other hand, no anodic peak ascribed to the oxidation of dysprosium metal was observed in this electroanalytical study. The diffusion coefficient and the activation energy for diffusion of the trivalent Dy complex in IL were estimated using semi-integral analysis, because it is important to analyze the diffusion properties to recover Dy through electrowinning methods. The diffusion coefficient of Dy(III) which was calculated to be 2.0??????10???12??m2??s???1 at 25????C, closed to that of the trivalent lanthanoid ion such as Eu(III) and Sm(III) in phosphonium-cation-based ionic liquid. In addition, the activation energy for diffusion was estimated to be 65??kJ??mol???1 (0.5??M) and 49??kJ??mol???1 (0.075??M). The estimated activation energy for diffusion was affected by the concentration of the electrolytic solution, since the RTILs had relatively strong electrostatic interactions between the metal cations and the solvent anions. Furthermore, the electrodeposition of Dy in phosphonium-cation-based IL was carried out using a two-electrode system constructed with a copper plate cathode and dysprosium metal anode. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of electrodeposits showed a sharply peaked spectrum corresponding to the characteristic X-ray lines of Dy. In addition, the obtained Dy, with the exception of the surface layer, was confirmed to be in the metallic electronic state by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",battery
"Hydrogen injection into and extraction from hydride-forming electrodes has been routinely investigated under the assumption that the electrode is homogeneous in structure and hydrogen transport through such electrodes is purely controlled by hydrogen diffusion. However, various kinds of abnormal behaviours in hydrogen transport, which could hardly be explained in terms of the diffusion-control model, have been quite frequently reported by many researchers. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the anomalous behaviours of hydrogen transport observed in such hydride-forming electrodes as Pd and metal-hydrides, with particular emphasis on hydrogen extraction under the impermeable boundary conditions during the potentiostatic current transient measurement involving the potential stepping. After a brief discourse on the conventional diffusion-control model, the topics related to the boundary conditions at the electrode surface during hydrogen extraction are extensively reviewed. In particular, it is shown that the diffusion-controlled constraint should be no longer valid at the electrode surface for hydrogen extraction in case hydrogen diffusion is influenced by either the interfacial charge transfer reaction or the hydrogen transfer reaction between adsorbed state on the electrode surface and absorbed state at the electrode sub-surface. Subsequently, the atypical behaviours of current transient due to hydrogen diffusion in the presence of traps and in the coexistence of two hydride phases are treated in detail. Each of the hydrogen extraction models suggested is discussed with the aid of the anodic current transients numerically calculated based upon the theoretical electrode potential curve, and then it is exemplified by hydrogen extraction from Pd and metal-hydrides in aqueous solutions.",battery
A highly porous three-dimensional Ni??Sn alloy foam is fabricated by electro-deposition accompanied by hydrogen evolution reaction. This foam can evolve into porous and dendritic metal alloy structures. These Sn-based electrodes have been evaluated for use as anodes in lithium-ion batteries. Dendritic Ni50Sn50 alloy foam exhibits high electrochemical capacity and excellent cycle stability during charge??discharge processes. The nickel in a Ni??Sn alloy does not break off during the volume expansion/contraction sequence in battery operation cycles and supports the Sn remaining on the anodes. The voids in the tube-like porous Ni??Sn morphology enhance the mass transfer of Li+ ions and act as mechanical bumpers during the charge??discharge processes.,battery

"ABSTRACT Polymer electrolytes (PEs) have served as the focus of intensive research as new ion-conducting materials, especially for lithium battery applications. A new strategy to develop fast lithium-conducting PEs is reported here. The thermal, ionic transport, and electrochemical properties of polymer solutions in a glyme-Li salt solvate ionic liquid, [Li(G4)1][TFSA], composed of an equimolar mixture of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide (Li[TFSA]) and tetraglyme (G4), were characterized. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) were combined with [Li(G4)1][TFSA] in order to explore the effects of polymer structure on the properties. The self-diffusion coefficient ratio of the glyme and Li+ ions (D G/D Li) was investigated to evaluate the stability of the complex (solvate) cations. The D G/D Li values suggested that the [Li(G4)1]+ complex cations underwent a ligand exchange reaction between G4 and PEO in the PEO-based solution, whereas the cations remained stable (D G/D Li =1) in the PMMA- and PBA-based solutions. The robustness of the [Li(G4)1]+ complex cations in the PMMA- and PBA-based solutions was reflected in high weight-loss temperature, greater Li transference number, and high oxidative stability. Owing to the lower glass transition temperature and low affinity towards Li+ ions, the PBA-based solutions yielded superior lithium transport properties (ionic conductivity of 10???4???10???3 Scm???1 and Li transference number as high as 0.5) among the investigated polymer solutions.",battery
"Layered Li1+x Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2 (x =0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) materials have been synthesized using citric acid assisted sol??gel method. The materials with excess lithium showed distinct differences in the structure and the charge and discharge characteristics. The rate capability tests were performed and compared on Li1+x Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2 (x =0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) cathode materials. Among these materials, Li1.10Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2 cathode demonstrated higher discharge capacity than that of the other cathodes. Upon extended cycling at 1C and 8C, Li1.10Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2 showed better capacity retention when compared to other materials with different lithium content. Li1.10Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2 exhibited 93 and 90% capacity retention where as Li1.05Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2, Li1.15Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2, and Li1.00Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2 exhibited only 84, 71, and 63% (at 1C), and 79, 66 and 40% (at 10C) capacity retention, respectively, after 40 cycles. The enhanced high rate cycleability of Li1.10Ni0.30Co0.30Mn0.40O2 cathode is attributed to the improved structural stability due to the formation of appropriate amount of Li2MnO3-like domains in the transition metal layer and decreased Li/Ni disorder (i.e., Ni content in the Li layer).",battery
"We prepared synthetic porous carbons with a three-dimensional interconnected network of ultramicroporous particles; by adjusting the synthesis parameters the size of these particles was systematically varied from 13nm to 1.4??m. Cyclic voltammetry measurements using a cavity microelectrode (CME) were performed in different chloric aqueous electrolyte solutions. The CME allows for very fast measurements (up to 10V/s) of carbon powders without the need of a binder or conductivity additive. Therewith we were able to investigate the accessibility of the ultramicropores and kinetics of the electrochemical double-layer (EDL) charging as a function of particle, inter-particular pore, effective ion and micropore size. We found, that the alkaline cations K+, Na+, Li+ and the anion Cl??? can enter micropores down to a size of 0.4nm at slow charging rates independent of the particle size. However, the accessibility is decreased due to kinetic limitations for the cations Na+ and Li+ at higher scan rates, which was not observed for the smaller K+ ion. A simple model is presented, which explains the influence of the particle, inter-particular pore and micropore size on the kinetics of double-layer charging. This model suggests that first of all the carbon particle size is not a limiting factor for fast EDL charging as long as its size is smaller than a few hundred nanometers and secondly inter-particular pores with a size in the range of the particle size or larger are crucial for high-rate applications.",battery
"Past studies on the factor validity of the Trait subscale of the Spielberger??s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) do unanimously agree on its structure. In fact, researchers are still debating whether the STAI-T is unidimensional or multidimensional. Our aim was to clarify what the STAI-T measures. The STAI-T, the Beck Depression Inventory??II, the Teate Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1124 psychiatric outpatients and to 877 healthy subjects. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed in order to compare various models in the literature. The internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity of the STAI-T as well as its factorial subscales were assessed. The one-construct two-method (i.e., the STAI-T measures one substantive anxiety construct plus artifacts due to negative??positive item polarity) and the bifactor (i.e., the STAI-T comprises two first-order specific factors [??Anxiety?? and ??Depression??] and one first-order general factor) models were the best-fitting solutions for the STAI??T in both the clinical and nonclinical samples. The STAI??T total score correlated more strongly with measures of depression than with a concurrent measure of anxiety. The STAI-T should be considered a measure of general negative affect, including specific aspects of cognitive anxiety and depression together.

"Li-rich layered oxide Li1.2Co0.13Ni0.13Mn0.54O2 has been successfully re-synthesized using the ascorbic acid leaching solution of spent lithium-ion batteries as the raw materials. A combination of oxalic acid co-precipitation, hydrothermal and calcination processes was applied to synthesize this material. For comparison, a fresh sample with the same composition has been also synthesized from the commercial raw materials using the same method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurements are carried out to characterize these samples. XRD results indicate that both samples have the layered ??-NaFeO2 structures with a space group of R 3 ?? m. No other crystalline phase was detected by XRD.

"Lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) are considered promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries because of their high reversible capacity, which is attributed to the exploitation of the novel anionic redox in addition to the conventional cationic redox process. Transition metal (TM) migration, which is known to be the main cause of the voltage decay in LLOs, is now understood to also be the critical factor triggering anionic redox, although this origin is still under debate. A better understanding of the specific TM migration behavior and its effect during charge/discharge would thus enable further development of this class of materials. Herein, we demonstrate that the unique TM migration during charge/discharge significantly alters the lithium diffusion mechanism/kinetics of LLO cathodes. We present clear evidence of the much more sluggish lithium diffusion occurring during discharge (lithiation) than during charge (de-lithiation), which contrasts with the traditional lithium diffusion model based on simple topotactic lithium intercalation/deintercalation in the layered framework. The reversible but asymmetric TM migration in the structure, which originates from the non-equivalent local environments around the TM during the charge and discharge processes, is shown to affect the lithium mobility. This correlation between TM migration and lithium mobility led us to propose a new lithium diffusion model for layered structures and suggests the importance of considering TM migration in designing new LLO cathode materials.

"The dispersion properties of carbon black (CB) slurries as well as the accompanying electrochemical properties of Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 (NCM) electrodes were investigated by controlling the amine value of polyurethane-based dispersants. The increase in amine value of dispersants leads to an increase in adsorption level on CB surface due to a strong acid/base interaction between dispersants and CB particles, providing the improvement of steric repulsion between particles at the solid??liquid interface. This results in the enhancement of the dispersion stability of CB and the related microstructure of the electrodes. Electrochemical experiments indicated that the rate capabilities and cycle performance of the electrodes are in good agreement with dispersion properties of CB slurries. However, it was found that the excessive addition of the dispersant was deleterious to electrochemical properties because the non-adsorbed dispersants act as an electronic conduction barrier between solid phases. Therefore, it is suggested that the amine value of dispersant and tailored amount of dispersant addition can be key roles for obtaining the optimized dispersion stability of CB and the corresponding excellent electrochemical properties of the cathode.",battery
"Summary This paper explores households?? coping strategies in rural South Africa, where HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality are having profound effects on household resources.

Although we stratified our sample by household mortality experience, the area??s high levels of migration, unemployment, and HIV/AIDS prevalence made our respondents?? pensions an important, regular, and reliable source of household-income regardless of their households?? mortality profile.",non-battery
"The level of functioning of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) varies widely. To better understand the neurobiological mechanism associated with high-functioning ASD, we studied the rare case of a female patient with an exceptional professional career in the highly competitive academic field of Mathematics. According to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, which proposes to describe the basic dimensions of functioning by integrating different levels of information, we conducted four fMRI experiments targeting the (1) social processes domain (Theory of mind (ToM) and face matching), (2) positive valence domain (reward processing), and (3) cognitive domain (N-back). Patient??s data were compared to data of 14 healthy controls (HC). Additionally, we assessed the subjective experience of our case during the experiments. The patient showed increased response times during face matching and achieved a higher total gain in the Reward task, whereas her performance in N-back and ToM was similar to HC. Her brain function differed mainly in the positive valence and cognitive domains. During reward processing, she showed reduced activity in a left-hemispheric frontal network and cortical midline structures but increased connectivity within this network. During the working memory task patients?? brain activity and connectivity in left-hemispheric temporo-frontal regions were elevated. In the ToM task, activity in posterior cingulate cortex and temporo-parietal junction was reduced. We suggest that the high level of functioning in our patient is rather related to the effects in brain connectivity than to local cortical information processing and that subjective report provides a fruitful framework for interpretation.

"Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted extensive interest due to their higher theoretical energy density than the current commercial lithium-ion batteries. However, their practical application is largely hindered by the low sulfur utilization and poor cycling stability. Restraining the shuttle effect and enhancing the electrochemical kinetics are important for developing high-performance Li-S batteries. Here we use carbon nanofibers (CNFs) supported manganese dioxide (MnO2) composite as a bifunctional coating on sulfur cathode for anchoring polysulfides and accelerating their redox reactions simultaneously. The CNFs/MnO2 composite supplies fast paths for electron transfer and ion diffusion, and greatly promotes the transformation processes of polysulfides to Li2S/Li2S2, leading to an enhanced electrochemical kinetics. The diffusion coefficient of lithium ion has been increased by 560%. As a result, the CNFs/MnO2 composite covered electrode exhibits an excellent cycling stability, its specific capacity maintains at about 600 mAh g???1 at 1C after 400 cycles, corresponding to a capacity decay as low as 0.063% per cycle, and the average coulombic efficiency reaches up to 99.66%.",battery
"An accurate state of charge (SoC) estimation of a traction battery in hybrid electric non-road vehicles, which possess higher dynamics and power densities than on-road vehicles, requires a precise battery cell terminal voltage model. This paper presents a novel methodology for non-linear system identification of battery cells to obtain precise battery models. The methodology comprises the architecture of local model networks (LMN) and optimal model based design of experiments (DoE). Three main novelties are proposed: 1) Optimal model based DoE, which aims to high dynamically excite the battery cells at load ranges frequently used in operation. 2) The integration of corresponding inputs in the LMN to regard the non-linearities SoC, relaxation, hysteresis as well as temperature effects. 3) Enhancements to the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT) construction algorithm, to achieve a physical appropriate interpretation of the LMN. The framework is applicable for different battery cell chemistries and different temperatures, and is real time capable, which is shown on an industrial PC. The accuracy of the obtained non-linear battery model is demonstrated on cells with different chemistries and temperatures.

"Electrodeposited crystalline Cu2Sb thin films are studied to evaluate the use of these electrodes as model systems for studying Cu2Sb as a lithium ion battery anode material. The films have been characterized with an emphasis on determining the film quality and relating the structure, composition, and morphology to the resulting electrochemical and morphological transformations that occur during electrochemical lithiation and delithiation. It is shown that electrodeposition can produce high quality films that are devoid of major defects and can be used to provide mechanistic insight on the electrochemistry of reversible lithium alloying. The CuxSb films show that the fundamental reaction mechanism remains largely unchanged for copper concentrations of 1>x>3. For the first time we show that the copper concentration greatly affects critical criteria for anode materials such as the initial coulombic efficiency and reversible capacity of the electrode material. Voltage limit experiments show that an overpotential is required to remove trapped lithium states. Additional ex-situ experiments reveal that internal strain created during the lithiation process is relieved by buckling, greatly altering the film surface area and geometry, and resulting in the formation of cracks upon delithiation. This process is only semi-reversible, and strained areas remain visible even when discharged outside the voltage window of Cu2Sb determined by differential capacity plots. The results presented here indicate that these electroplated thin films are useful as analytical tools for showing pathways to improving the performance and fundamental understanding of alloy based lithium-ion battery anodes.",battery
"Two types of ultracapacitor modules have been developed for use as energy-storage devices for 42-V systems in automobiles. The modules show high performance and good reliability in terms of discharge and recharge capability, long-term endurance, and high energy and power. During a 42-V system simulation test of 6-kW power boosting/regenerative braking, the modules demonstrate very good performance. In high-power applications such as 42-V and hybrid vehicle systems, ultracapacitors have many merits compared with batteries, especially with respect to specific power at high rate, thermal stability, charge??discharge efficiency, and cycle-life. Ultracapacitors are also very safe, reliable and environmentally friendly. The cost of ultracapacitors is still high compared with batteries because of the low production scale, but is decreasing very rapidly. It is estimated that the cost of ultracapacitors will decrease to US$ 300 per 42-V module in the near future. Also, the maintenance cost of the ultracapacitor is nearly zero because of its high cycle-life. Therefore, the combined cost of the capacitor and maintenance will be lower than that of batteries in the near future.

"We examined the stability of and cross-influences between externalizing behaviors and intervention engagement among children participating in a randomized clinical trial of an intervention for disruptive behavioral youth. Analyses also accounted for the influence of caregiver depression, family relationship quality, and sociodemographic factors (race, income) on the relationship between behaviors and intervention engagement. Analyses were based on 118 children participating in the Coping Power intervention. Composite variables were created to represent externalizing behaviors and intervention engagement constructs. Associations between these composite variables were examined over 24 treatment sessions. Findings indicated a regressive relationship among externalizing behaviors, i.e., baseline externalizing behaviors were positively associated with immediate follow-up behaviors. There were also dynamic relationships observed among engagement constructs. Notably, engagement with in-session activities during sessions 1??8 was positively associated with out-of-session activity engagement during the same treatment time period. Engagement with out-of-session activities during sessions 1??8 was positively associated with in-session activity engagement during sessions 9??16, indicating a complete mediation between early and middle in-session engagement through the mechanism of early out-of-session engagement. A crosslag relationship was observed: middle in-session engagement was negatively associated with externalizing behaviors at immediate follow-up. Finally, an interaction of race by income on immediate follow-up externalizing behaviors was observed, such that Black children??s externalizing behaviors remain static regardless of income level while White children??s behaviors decreased with higher income.

"Drawing from the dual process model of morality and life history theory, the present research examined the role of cognitive and emotional processes as bridges between basic environmental challenges (i.e., unpredictability and competition) and other-centered moral orientation (i.e., prioritizing the welfare of others). In two survey studies, cognitive and emotional processes represented by future-oriented planning and emotional attachment, respectively (Study 1, N??=??405), or by perspective taking and empathic concern, respectively (Study 2, N??=??424), positively predicted other-centeredness in prosocial moral reasoning (Study 1) and moral judgment dilemmas based on rationality or intuition (Study 2). Cognitive processes were more closely related to rational aspects of other-centeredness, whereas the emotional processes were more closely related to the intuitive aspects of other-centeredness (Study 2). Finally, the cognitive and emotional processes also mediated negative effects of unpredictability (i.e., negative life events and childhood financial insecurity), as well as positive effects of individual-level, contest competition (i.e., educational and occupational competition) on other-centeredness.

"The electrochemistry of superdense ??LiC2?? prepared by ball-milling has been investigated in EC-DMC solutions 1 M LiClO4.

Due to the complex nature of the compound prepared by ball-milling (a mixture of lithium metal, LiC3 and LiC6) the mechanism of the first deintercalation is rather complex.

"A physics-based Li-ion battery (LIB) aging model accounting for both lithium plating and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth is presented, and is applied to study the aging behavior of a cell undergoing prolonged cycling at moderate operating conditions. Cell aging is found to be linear in the early stage of cycling but highly nonlinear in the end with rapid capacity drop and resistance rise. The linear aging stage is found to be dominated by SEI growth, while the transition from linear to nonlinear aging is attributed to the sharp rise of lithium plating rate. Lithium plating starts to occur in a narrow portion of the anode near the separator after a certain number of cycles. The onset of lithium plating is attributed to the drop of anode porosity associated with SEI growth, which aggravates the local electrolyte potential gradient in the anode. The presence of lithium metal accelerates the porosity reduction, further promoting lithium plating. This positive feedback leads to exponential increase of lithium plating rate in the late stage of cycling, as well as local pore clogging near the anode/separator interface which in turn leads to a sharp resistance rise.",battery

"In the present paper, the composition of several spinel-type ??-MnO2 samples (which absorb lithium ions with a high selectivity in an aqueous solution) is analyzed and the correlation between the composition and the absorption capacity of lithium is investigated experimentally. Then samples of ??-MnO2 with different hydrogen contents are prepared, and each lithium absorption capacity is measured. The results indicate that the absorption capacity of lithium is proportional to the content of hydrogen ions with the ability to ion exchange. Furthermore, it is concluded that the reason for the selective absorption of lithium ions in ??-MnO2 is not based upon the so-called ion sieve effect emphasized conventionally, but is based upon a proper ion exchange reaction which occurs only between lithium and hydrogen ions.",battery
"Neuropsychological evaluation of a patient's cognitive capabilities before and after epilepsy surgery is essential in elective epilepsy surgery. On the one hand, neuropsychology provides accessory information regarding the localization and lateralization of epilepsy-associated cognitive impairment; on the other hand, it is a useful tool for quality and outcome control of epilepsy surgery which helps to make surgery more effective and safe. Evaluation of the adequacy of the brain tissues to be resected and of the patient's mental reserve capacities allows for a prediction of the postoperative cognitive development. Successful surgery can stop mental decline due to chronic epilepsy and it can reverse this negative trend by release of functions and capacities that were secondarily affected before surgery. However, surgery bears the risk of additional impairments which, in interaction with normal or even pathological processes of mental aging, may accelerate cognitive decline at an older age. From a neuropsychological point of view, early recognition of pharmacoresistance is important along with early and complete seizure control with maximal sparing of functional tissues.",non-battery
"Strength-based parenting (SBP) is a style of parenting characterized by knowledge and encouragement of a child??s unique personality, abilities, talents, and skills (i.e., strengths). Recent studies have demonstrated a unique contribution of SBP, above other parenting styles, in predicting a range of wellbeing indicators in adolescents. Given that wellbeing supports learning, and SBP predicts wellbeing, it is also plausible that adolescents with strength-based parents will have greater academic achievement. At the beginning of term, students from a public secondary school in Australia (N??=??741, Mage??=??13.70, SD??=??1.33; 50% female) completed a self-report survey measuring perceptions of parental style, engagement, and perseverance. Subsequent academic results were obtained 3??months later. SBP predicted higher wellbeing in the form of adolescent engagement and perseverance. SBP also demonstrated a significant effect on academic achievement which was mediated by perseverance, but not engagement. Thus, results supported a model in which adolescents with strength-based parents achieved higher grades via increased perseverance. Results reaffirm the importance of the parent-student link, and dispositional qualities of engagement and perseverance, in predicting educational outcomes such as grades. This study extends positive education research beyond the classroom by demonstrating that positive parenting techniques like SBP can predict student wellbeing and academic achievement.

"Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) afford a profound impact on our modern daily life. However, LIBs are approaching the theoretical energy density, due to the inherent limitations of intercalation chemistry; thus, they cannot further satisfy the increasing demands of portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grids. Therefore, battery chemistries beyond LIBs are being widely investigated. Next-generation lithium (Li) batteries, which employ Li metal as the anode and intercalation or conversion materials as the cathode, receive the most intensive interest due to their high energy density and excellent potential for commercialization. Moreover, significant progress has been achieved in Li batteries attributed to the increasing fundamental understanding of the materials and reactions, as well as to technological improvement. This review starts by summarizing the electrolytes for next-generation Li batteries. Key challenges and recent progress in lithium-ion, lithium??sulfur, and lithium??oxygen batteries are then reviewed from the perspective of energy and chemical engineering science. Finally, possible directions for further development in Li batteries are presented.

"Major aspects related to lithium deposition in lithium-ion and lithium metal secondary batteries are reviewed. For lithium-ion batteries with carbonaceous anode, lithium deposition may occur under harsh charging conditions such as overcharging or charging at low temperatures. The major technical solutions include: (1) applying electrochemical models to predict the critical conditions for deposition initiation; (2) preventions by improved battery design and material modification; (3) applying adequate charging protocols to inhibit lithium deposition. For lithium metal secondary batteries, the lithium deposition is the inherent reaction during charging. The major technical solutions include: (1) the use of mechanistic models to elucidate and control dendrite initiation and growth; (2) engineering surface morphology of the lithium deposition to avoid dendrite formation via adjusting the composition and concentration of the electrolyte; (3) controlling battery working conditions. From a survey of the literature, the areas that require further study are proposed; e.g., refining the lithium deposition criteria, developing an effective AC self pre-heating method for low-temperature charging of lithium-ion batteries, and clarifying the role the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays in determining the deposition morphology; to facilitate a refined control of the lithium deposition.",battery

"Binder, one of the most important battery components, plays a critical role in lithium??sulfur batteries. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF), a commonly used binder in lithium??sulfur batteries, does not have a strong affinity to the intermediate polysulfides, however, leading to fast capacity fading with electrochemical cycling. Herein, copolymers of vinylidene difluoride with other monomers are used as multi-functional binders to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium??sulfur batteries. Compared to the PVDF, the copolymer, poly(vinylidene difluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TRFE)) binder exhibits higher adhesion strength, less porosity, and stronger chemical interaction with polysulfides, which helps to keep the polysulfides within the cathode region, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of the lithium??sulfur battery.

"As the cooling energy demand in buildings is set to increase dramatically in the future, the exploitation of passive solutions like natural ventilation could prove vital in reducing the reliance on mechanical systems. Models that can predict air temperature accurately in naturally ventilated mode are key to understanding the potential of natural ventilation now and in the future. This article presents a simulation based case study of a retrofitted nearly zero energy test-bed university building, in naturally ventilated mode only. The study had three aims: (1) calibration and validation of a whole building energy model, (2) a comparative analysis of occupancy schedules and opening control strategies, and (3) a comparison of researcher and practitioner approaches. Results showed the detailed building model was capable of predicting room level air temperature with a low level of error (0.27 ??C ???

The comparative analysis highlighted the need to consider occupancy schedules that have a wide range of diversity, and opening control strategies that reflect the manual and automated relationship in natural ventilation systems. The approach comparison highlighted that both practitioner and researcher approaches to simulating both occupancy schedules and opening control strategies showed similar levels of performance for the application considered.

"The electrochemical lithium insertion into a-Si:H thin-film electrodes, CVD-grown on stainless-steel substrates at 100 and 250??C, is studied using chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is shown that the discharge capacity of the films deposited at 250??C is higher than that of the equally thick films deposited at 100??C. For the films deposited at 250??C, the dependence of their discharge capacity on the thickness is found. The increase in the film thickness involves a more drastic decrease of the discharge capacity during the potential cycling; in particular, for the 0.25??m- and 1.35??m-thick films, their discharge capacity at a current density of 0.175mA/cm2 in the 3rd cycle is ???2 Ah/g; in the 100th cycle, 1.10 and 0.37Ah/g, respectively. An equivalent circuit is suggested for the lithium insertion to the electrodes, which comprises the electrolyte resistance and three RC-chains in series, each chain being a parallel connection of a resistance and a constant-phase element, which relate to charge transfer at the silicon/electrolyte interface, charge transport in the passive film on silicon, and the lithium diffusion into the silicon bulk.

"The effects of temperatures in the range of ???20 ??C to 70 ??C on the ageing behaviour of cycled Lithium-ion batteries are investigated quantitatively by electrochemical methods and Post-Mortem analysis.

The cells were cycled at a rate of 1 C until the discharge capacity falls below 80% of the initial capacity.

The effect of different temperatures on the electrode polarizations are evaluated by assembling electrodes in pouch cells with reference electrode as a model system.

"As Europe moves towards renewable energy, hydropower stands out as a renewable technology that can provide supply side flexibility through dispatchable electricity production. Several studies have investigated the flexibility hydropower can provide with a particular focus on the Nordic hydropower resources. Of all European countries, Norway has the largest hydropower resources and storage capacity. However, Norway also has a highly electrified heating sector, which means high electricity demand during winter when reservoirs are low. This paper uses EnergyPLAN to analyse how a shift from individual electric heating to district heating affects the flexibility the Norwegian energy system can provide to Europe. The analysis develops a 2015 reference scenario and two scenarios that introduce district heating based on biomass and heat pumps, respectively. Results show that district heating can decrease the maximum load on dammed hydropower facilities, thus freeing up capacity for potential export. Furthermore, the dammed hydropower facilities are able to balance the electricity demands in all hours of the year. However, the shift to district heating also increases forced export to drain reservoirs as domestic electricity demand is reduced. Also, the amount of import the system is able to handle is decreased under the modelled conditions.",battery
"We propose a novel low-cost synthesis method of a LiFePO4/C composite with excellent battery performances that combine high-frequency induction heating with carbothermal reduction.

Although the initially synthesized LiFePO4/C (LFP-120) contains such over-reduction impurities as Fe2P or Fe3P, optimized LiFePO4/C (LFP-90) containing no impurities is obtained by adjusting the heating time. Moreover, the primary particle size of the LFP-90 is sufficiently small to achieve fast Li-ion diffusion.

"Excitotoxicity underlies neuronal death in many neuropathological disorders, such as Alzheimer??s disease and multiple sclerosis. In murine models of these diseases, disruption of CX3CR1 signaling has thus far generated data either in favor or against a neuroprotective role of this crucial regulator of microglia and monocyte functions. In this study, we investigated the recruitment of circulating PU.1-expressing cells following sterile excitotoxicity and delineated the CX3CR1-dependent neuroprotective functions of circulating monocytes versus that of microglia in this context. WT, Cx3cr1-deficient and chimeric mice were subjected to a sterile excitotoxic insult via an intrastriatal injection of kainic acid (KA), a conformational analog of glutamate. Following KA administration, circulating monocytes physiologically engrafted the brain and selectively accumulated in the vicinity of excitotoxic lesions where they gave rise to activated macrophages depicting strong Iba1 and CD68 immunoreactivity 7??days post-injury. Monocyte-derived macrophages completely vanished upon recovery and did thus not permanently seed the brain. Furthermore, Cx3cr1 deletion significantly exacerbated neuronal death, behavioral deficits and activation of microglia cells following sterile excitotoxicity. Cx3cr1 disruption also markedly altered the blood levels of patrolling monocytes 24??h after KA administration. The specific elimination of patrolling monocytes using Nr4a1???/??? chimeric mice conditioned with chemotherapy provided direct evidence that these circulating monocytes are essential for neuroprotection. Taken together, these data support a beneficial role of CX3CR1 signaling during excitotoxicity and highlight a novel and pivotal role of patrolling monocytes in neuroprotection. These findings open new research and therapeutic avenues for neuropathological disorders implicating excitotoxicity.

"The cause of the thermal runaway problem in lithium-ion batteries problem is still unclear. This bottle neck has prevented increases in the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, of which the technology may stagnate for many years. The diversity of cell chemistries makes this problem more difficult to analyze. This paper reports work conducted by Tsinghua University and its collaborators into the establishment of a thermal analysis database. The database contains comparable data for different kinds of cells using accelerating rate calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Three characteristic temperatures are summarized based on the common features of the cells in the database. In attempting to explain the mechanisms that are responsible for the characteristic temperature phenomena, we have gained new insight into the thermal runaway mechanisms of lithium-ion batteries. The results of specially designed tests show that the major heat source during thermal runaway for cells with Li(NixCoyMnz)O2 cathode and carbon-based anode is the redox reaction between the cathode and anode at high temperature. In contrast to what is commonly thought, internal short circuits are responsible for very little of the total heat generated during thermal runaway, although they contribute to triggering the redox reactions after the separator collapses. The characteristic temperatures provide comparable parameters that are useful in judging the safety of a newly designed battery cell. Moreover, the novel interpretation of the thermal runaway mechanism provide guidance for the safety modelling and design of lithium-ion batteries.",battery

"Despite the promising future of lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery in replacing conventional lithium ion battery for high-energy applications, the complicated reaction mechanisms determining the sluggish discharge-charge kinetics have not been fully understood. Here, utilizing in situ liquid transmission electron microscopy, the (electro)chemical fundamentals in a working Li-O2 battery is explored. During discharge, the nucleation of Li2O2 is observed at the carbon electrode/electrolyte interface, and the following growth process exhibits Li+ diffusion-limited kinetics. Nucleation and growth of Li2O2 are also observed within the electrolyte, where there is no direct contact with the carbon electrode indicating the existence of non-Faradaic disproportionation reaction of intermediate LiO2 into Li2O2. The growth of Li2O2 isolated in the electrolyte exhibits O2 - diffusion-limited kinetics. Li2O2 at the carbon electrode surface and isolated in the electrolyte are both active upon charging and gradually decomposed. For Li2O2 particles rooted at the carbon electrode surface, the decomposition starts at the electrode/Li2O2 interface indicating electron-conduction limited charge kinetics. For Li2O2 isolated within the electrolyte, surprisingly, a side-to-side decomposition mode is identified indicating the non-Faradaic formation of dissolvable O2 -, whose diffusion in the electrolyte controls the overall charge kinetics. This work reveals further details of underlying mechanisms in a working Li-O2 battery and identifies various limiting factors controlling the discharge and charge processes.",battery

This timing was achieved by two sets of relay switches. One set was used to disconnect the patch pipette electrode from the pre-amplifier and connect it to a battery to maintain membrane potential at ???70??mV, and also to disconnect the reference electrode from the amplifier. The other set was used to disconnect the electrodes from the pulse generator until the time of NEP/sham exposure. The sequence and timing of both sets of relays were computer-controlled. Using this procedure, we observed that a 5-ns pulse induced an instantaneous inward current that decayed exponentially over the course of several minutes, that a second pulse induced a similar response, and that the current was carried, at least in part, by Na+. This approach for characterizing ion conductance changes in an excitable cell in response to NEPs will yield information essential for assessing the potential use of NEP stimulation for therapeutic applications.

"Utilities have greatly increased the use of time-of-use (TOU) rate structures for residential customers to more closely match the cost of delivered electricity as well as demand tariffs to incentivize a temporal shift in residential energy use. However current research tends to focus on a particular climate or location. This study analyzes four residences across four different climate zones in Arizona and explores the value of adding battery storage to a net-zero energy (NZE) photovoltaic (PV) system. Using the National Renewable Energy Lab's Building Optimization (BEopt) and System Advisor Model (SAM) tools, this study performs parametric analysis by varying battery size to determine a capacity that produces a maximum net present value (NPV). A sensitivity analysis on three possible future battery price trends is also performed. This study finds the NZE PV systems are only able to mitigate 37??44% of the peak electricity purchases and 4??12% of demand charges due to mismatch between solar potential and on-peak hours. Adding large batteries, 1.5??1.6 times larger than required to meet the annual peak energy purchase requirements, provides a maximum NPV for PV-battery systems at locations with favorable utility rates. We conclude that the best economics are achieved, at both current and expected future battery prices, when batteries are sized to never require replacement during the PV system lifetime.",battery
"With the advancement of smart home and grid, a more connected and efficient operation of the grid is achievable. Involving buildings as the largest consumer of electricity in such a smart operation is a critical step in achieving an interactive grid system. In this paper, a building energy management system is introduced considering electricity price and people behavior, controlling major consumers of electricity in a single family residential building. An air conditioner, water heater, electric vehicle, and battery storages are controlled in a photovoltaic (PV) equipped building. A model predictive control is designed to minimize the operation cost considering system model, electricity price and people behavior patterns in each device control. Centralized and stand-alone configuration of MPC for building energy management is formulated and were put in contrast for time of use pricing (TOU), hourly pricing and five minutes pricing. Simulation results show that in real time five minutes pricing these methods can achieve 20%??30% cost savings in different appliances, and 42% savings in overall electricity cost adding battery optimal control compared to traditional rule based control. Cost savings and peak shaving results demonstrate the capabilities of introduced price and behavior based control.",non-battery

"Carbon black supercapacitors that employ thin (???1??m) electrodes were produced by coating and inkjet printing on a conventional current collector or directly on a separator membrane. The simplicity and diversity of ultrathin electrode fabrication were facilitated by the physical form of carbon black, which can be described as a fine particle of around 100nm in size. It was established that the performance of carbon black in thin supercapacitor electrodes may be compared with carbon nanotube and graphene materials in those instances where fast frequency response is desired from the supercapacitor. At the same time, the fast response supercapacitors that employ nanotubes and graphenes have presently involved more elaborate fabrication routes.

"Depression affects 7% of the elderly population, and it often remains misdiagnosed or untreated. Peripheral biomarkers might aid clinicians by allowing more accurate and well-timed recognition of the disease. We sought to determine if plasma protein levels predict the severity of depressive symptomatology or distinguish patients from healthy individuals. The severity of depressive symptoms and global cognitive functioning were assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in 152 elderly subjects, 76 of which with major depressive disorder (MDD). Plasma levels of 24 proteins were measured by multiplexing and analyzed as continuous predictors or dichotomized using the median value. The association between individual plasma proteins and MDD risk or depressive symptoms severity was investigated using multiple logistic and linear regressions including relevant covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding cognitively impaired individuals or non-acute patients with MDD. After adjusting for possible confounders and false discovery rate (FDR) correction, we found lower Fetuin-A levels in MDD patients vs. controls (pFDR??=??1.95??????10??6). This result was confirmed by the sensitivity and dichotomized analyses. Lower prolactin (PRL) levels predicted more severe depressive symptoms in acute MDD patients (pFDR??=??0.024). Fetuin-A is a promising biomarker of MDD in the elderly as this protein was negatively associated with the disorder in our sample, regardless of the global cognitive functioning. Lower PRL levels may be a peripheral signature of impaired neuroprotective processes and serotoninergic neurotransmission in more severely depressed patients.",non-battery

"Supercapacitors have been widely viewed as one promising candidate of next-generation energy storage devices. To configure a supercapacitor with high-charge storage for practical applications, it is one of urgent issues to take up effective/universal strategies to well tailor electrode materials for desired properties and functions. As one of representative materials with intrinsic pseudocapacitive behaviors, MnO2 is attractive because of high theoretical capacitance value and large potential window. Nevertheless, a wide gap between the practical and theoretical capacitance value greatly hinders its further applications and remains a major challenge. Herein, we systematically reviewed recent advances on activating intrinsic capacitive properties of MnO2 to shorten this distance, which was classified into five branches including conductive species coupling, single/few-layers constructing, heterojunction configuring, defects engineering and metal doping. In addition, an outlook on the practical applications of MnO2 and involved potential challenges in energy storage field was discussed and highlighted. It is believed that this article can function as a momentum calling for more endeavors into development of advanced electrode materials with fasinating capacitive performance.",battery
"Graphene is a promising electrode material for energy storage applications. The most successful method for preparing graphene from graphite involves the oxidation of graphite to graphene oxide (GO) and reduction back to graphene. Even though different chemical and thermal methods have been developed to reduce GO to graphene, the use of less toxic materials to generate graphene still remains a challenge. In this study we developed a facile one-pot synthesis of deoxygenated graphene (hGO) via alkaline hydrothermal process, which exhibits similar properties to the graphene obtained via hydrazine reduction (i.e. the same degree of deoxygenation found in hydrazine reduced GO). Moreover, the hGO formed freestanding, binder-free paper electrodes for supercapacitors. Coin cell type (CR2032) symmetric supercapacitors were assembled using the hGO electrodes. Electrochemical characterization of hGO was carried out using lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and ethylmethylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) electrolytes. The results for the hGO electrodes were compared with the hydrazine reduced GO (rGO) electrode. The hGO electrode exhibits a energy density of 20 W h kg???1 and 50 W h kg???1 in LiTFSI and EMITFSI respectively, while delivering a maximum power density of 11 kW kg???1 and 14.7 kW kg???1 in LiTFSI and EMITFSI, respectively.",battery
"A novel rechargeable hybrid Na-seawater flow battery, using natural seawater as an abundant source of active materials, have been developed recently. In this kind of metal-air battery, electrochemical oxygen evolution and reduction are the two key processes taking place during charging and discharging, respectively. In general, powder form of electrocatalysts are attached to the current collectors by using inactive and insulating polymer binders, which inevitably impede the overall performance, and increase the manufacturing costs of the battery.

"In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of five phenomena of LiNi1-2xCoxMnxO2 (NCM) (x = 0??1/3) cathodes at the end of charge (phase reaction, crack propagation, Li-Ni exchange, phase transition, and oxygen evolution), using first-principle calculations within the DFT + U framework. Based on our results, we have located the obstacles toward unity efficiency and revealed that the degradation strongly depends on the Ni concentration and the depth of charge. The threshold capacities for degradation of LiyNi1-2xCoxMnxO2 are 130??140 mA??hg???1 (y < 0.5) for 1/4 ??? x = 1/3 (33.33??50% of Ni), and 200??210 mA??hg???1 (y < 0.25) for 0 ??? x = 1/4 (50??100% of Ni), respectively. For 1/4 ??? x = 1/3, our results show that the origin of the degradation is the oxidation of O2???, which is the result of the pining of O-p and Ni-d bands at the valence band edge. For 0 ??? x = 1/4, lattice distortion and Li-Ni exchange are the mechanisms responsible for the degradation of the cathode material, leading to severe structural instabilities in the Ni-rich region (x = 0.1). Our findings will help to rationally design NCM cathode materials with high-energy density, also providing possible solution mechanisms to the degradation factors, such as doping, coating or novel nanostructures, like core-shell or concentration gradient cathodes.",battery
"A novel conducting polymer of polynaphthidine, poly(NAP), was synthesized electrochemically by direct anodic oxidation of naphthidine in aqueous media. The yield of the electropolymerization reaction depends on the temperature and pH of the solution. It was possible to differentiate two working regions: I (for pH<0.5 and all temperatures) where the film yield tends to zero and II (for approximately 2.0<pH<2.8 and temperatures >15??C) where the film production is maximum. Therefore, the naphthidine electrooxidation mechanism was studied under experimental conditions of region I by cyclic (CV) and square wave voltammetries (SWV) as well as by controlled potential electrolysis. The experimental conditions of region II were chosen to obtain the poly(NAP). The electrochemical response of the film was investigated in pH 1 HClO4 +0.1M NaClO4 electrolyte solution by CV and SWV. A plot of I p,n/f vs. f from SW voltammograms showed the so-called ??quasi-reversible maximum??. Formal potential, formal rate constant and anodic transfer coefficient for the surface redox process were also evaluated from the SWV.

In general, the presence of cobalt in the alloys causes a decrease on the hydrogen equilibrium pressure and on the rate of capacity decay, and an increase in the cycle life and on the alloy activation time.

"Optimal investment in battery energy storage systems, taking into account degradation, sizing and control, is crucial for the deployment of battery storage, of which providing frequency control is one of the major applications. In this paper, we present a holistic, data-driven framework to determine the optimal investment, size and controller of a battery storage system providing frequency control. We optimised the controller towards minimum degradation and electricity costs over its lifetime, while ensuring the delivery of frequency control services compliant with regulatory requirements. We adopted a detailed battery model, considering the dynamics and degradation when exposed to actual frequency data. Further, we used a stochastic optimisation objective while constraining the probability on unavailability to deliver the frequency control service. Through a thorough analysis, we were able to decrease the amount of data needed and thereby decrease the execution time while keeping the approximation error within limits. Using the proposed framework, we performed a techno-economic analysis of a battery providing 1 MW capacity in the German primary frequency control market. Results showed that a battery rated at 1.6 MW, 1.6 MWh has the highest net present value, yet this configuration is only profitable if costs are low enough or in case future frequency control prices do not decline too much. It transpires that calendar ageing drives battery degradation, whereas cycle ageing has less impact.",battery
"A facile solvothermal way to immobilize nanocrystalline LiMn2O4 on the surface of graphene nanosheets is developed to improve the functionality of lithium manganate as lithium intercalation electrode. A solvothermal treatment for the colloidal mixture of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and LiMn2O4 nanocrystals gives rise not only to the reduction of GO to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) but also to the immobilization of lithium manganate nanoparticles on the surface of RGO nanosheets. According to powder X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic analyses, the crystal structure and morphology of spinel lithium manganate remain intact upon the composite formation with the RGO nanosheets. The application of larger aldehyde molecule as a reductant leads to the increase of crystallinity and the lowering of Mn oxidation state for the pristine LiMn2O4 and its nanocomposite with the RGO nanosheets. The present LiMn2O4??RGO nanocomposites display promising cathode performances for lithium rechargeable batteries, which are much superior to those of the pristine LiMn2O4 nanocrystals. The observed enhancement of electrode performance upon the composite formation with the RGO nanosheets is attributable both to the improvement of the surface ion transport of nanocrystalline lithium manganate and to the increase of electrical conductivity. The present experimental findings demonstrate that the solvothermal treatment with RGO nanosheets provides an effective way of improving the electrochemical activity of nanocrystalline lithium metal oxides.",battery

"In this paper, we report a modeling methodology on the transient behaviors of a lithium-ion battery (LIB) during dynamic cycling. To account for the short time effects of current pulses and rest periods, the nonfaradaic component of the current density transferred through the separator between the positive and negative electrodes is included based on the lumped double-layer capacitance. Two-dimensional modeling is performed to predict the transient behaviors of an LIB cell during dynamic cycling. To validate the modeling approach presented in this work, modeling results for the variations in cell voltage and two-dimensional temperature distribution of the LIB cell as a function of time are compared with the experimental data for constant-current discharge and charge cycles and the Heavy Duty Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule cycles.

The results show that the area normalized charge that can be stored simultaneously on both sides is significantly lower than could be stored on just one side of single layer graphene, consistent with charge storage having a quantum capacitance component. These measurements are also consistent with the specific capacitance of graphene materials as previously measured in supercapacitor cells and provide a basis for the further understanding and development of graphene based materials for electrical energy storage.

"Individual differences in vulnerability to neurobehavioral performance impairment during sleep deprivation are considerable and represent a neurobiological trait. Genetic polymorphisms reported to be predictors have suggested the involvement of the homeostatic and circadian processes of sleep regulation in determining this trait. We applied mathematical and statistical modeling of these two processes to psychomotor vigilance performance and sleep physiological data from a laboratory study of repeated exposure to 36h of total sleep deprivation in 9 healthy young adults. This served to quantify the respective contributions of individual differences in the two processes to the magnitudes of participants?? individual vulnerabilities to sleep deprivation. For the homeostatic process, the standard deviation for individual differences was found to be about 60% as expressed relative to its group-average contribution to neurobehavioral performance impairment. The same was found for the circadian process. Across the span of the total sleep deprivation period, the group-average effect of the homeostatic process was twice as big as that of the circadian process. In absolute terms, therefore, the impact of the individual differences in the homeostatic process was twice as large as the impact of the individual differences in the circadian process in this study. These modeling results indicated that individualized applications of mathematical models predicting performance on the basis of a homeostatic and a circadian process should account for individual differences in both processes.",non-battery

"Background To determine whether increasing claudication severity is associated with impaired balance and physical functional ability. Methods A prospective observational study in claudicants was performed. Disease severity was determined according to Rutherford??s criteria. Patient??s balance was assessed objectively using computerized dynamic posturography (CDP??Sensory Organization Test [SOT]; NeuroCom). ??Bedside?? assessment of balance was performed using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test (dynamic balance) and the Full Tandem Stance test (static balance). Physical function was assessed using the Summary Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score. Results 185 claudicants were assessed (median age of 69 [IQR 63??74] years; 137 [74.1%] men). Fourteen claudicants were classified as Rutherford grade 0, 26 as grade I, 76 as grade II, and 69 as grade III. All Rutherford groups were comparable for age, gender, BMI, and comorbidities. Increasing Rutherford grade was associated with a significant deterioration in objective balance as determined by a failed SOT test: 3 (21.4%) in grade 0; 9 (34.6%) in grade I; 39 (52.7%) in grade II; and 41 (59.4%) in grade III (chi-squared 9.693, df 3, P = 0.021). A significant difference was also found with dynamic balance (TUG test), but not static balance (full tandem stance). Increasing claudication severity was also associated with significantly worse physical function: SPPB score. Conclusions Specific objective tests demonstrate impaired balance and physical function are common in claudicants and become more frequent with increasing severity of claudication. Simple ??bedside?? measures may be sufficiently sensitive to detect this.",non-battery
"Rejects from selective collection are municipal solid waste (MSW) not used for recycling and are, therefore, destined for the landfill in Brazil. Knowledge of the composition and generation of this waste is important for strategically planning public policies that minimize its generation and its negative environmental impacts. However, this portion of MSW is not very well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the rejects from the sorting process of the selective waste collection in the municipality of Blumenau, in the State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. The studied rejects came from the largest cooperative in the city, and its composition was sorted into 17 categories of 101 samples over the course of one year, with a total of 3893 kg of analyzed rejects. The waste collected by the selective collection of the municipality was evaluated monthly to determine which part of this quantity became rejects and to determine the composition and seasonality of these rejects. The study found that 30.5% of the waste sorted by the cooperative was rejected. Among these rejects, the presence of materials that could be marketed by the cooperative was verified. Hazardous and/or legally prohibited waste were also identified, as were organics, construction and demolition waste, health care waste, electronics, textiles, footwear, batteries, and bulbs. Seasonal analysis indicated a concerning constant generation of health care waste. Aside from that, there was an increase in the generation of waste from electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) during the Christmas period, when a large part of the population discards their EEE. This information is important for the enforcement of the MSW management structure as well as for educational campaigns aimed at the correct separation of waste that should be sent for selective collection.",non-battery
"The K2FeO4/TiB2 battery has a significant advantage of battery capacity due to their multi-electron discharge reaction both of the cathode K2FeO4 (3e???) and the anode TiB2 (6e???). However, the more positive reduction potential of TiB2 anode results in a lower discharge voltage plateau of K2FeO4/TiB2 battery, compared with the K2FeO4/Zn battery. The simple modification of Fe(VI) cathode with CuO additive was used to improve the cathode reduction kinetics and decrease the polarization potential in the discharge process. Another electrocatalysis media RuO2 with excellent electric conductivity is used as additive in K2FeO4 cathode to demonstrate which effect is more important for the discharge voltage plateau, electrocatalysis or electron conductivity of additives. The results show that the 5% CuO additive modified K2FeO4/TiB2 battery exhibits an enhanced discharge voltage plateau (1.5V) and a higher cathode specific capacity (327mAh/g). The advanced discharge voltage plateau can be due to the electrocatalysis of additives on the electrochemical reduction kinetics of Fe(VI) cathode in the whole discharge process, rather than the good electronic conductivity of additives.",battery

"In this paper, a novel method to generate electrical energy by converting available mechanical energy from pressure fluctuations of the cerebrospinal fluid within lateral ventricles of the brain is presented. The generated electrical power can be supplied to the neural implants and either eliminate their battery need or extend the battery lifespan. A diaphragm type harvester comprised of piezoelectric material is utilized to convert the pressure fluctuations to electrical energy. The pressure fluctuations cause the diaphragm to bend, and the strained piezoelectric materials generate electricity.

A 1:1 model of lateral ventricles was 3D??printed from raw MRI images to characterize the harvester.

"This paper presents a life-cycle analysis for a new concept in solar thermal power generation. BRRIMS denotes Brayton-cycle, re-heated, recuperated, integrated, modular and storage-equipped. This concept envisages collection temperatures of around 250 ??C, thermal storage in pebble beds, thermal-electric conversion in a piston??cylinder engine and air as the heat transfer fluid and working gas of the engine. The analysis applies to the manufacturing phase of the overall power plant and separately to the pebble bed thermal storage component. Three sustainability metrics are included ?? life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative energy demand and energy payback time. On these metrics, the BRRIMS concept has broadly similar results to a conventional parabolic trough plant with molten salt thermal storage.",battery
" It has been shown that songbird migrants can use several compass cues for orientation (e.g. sun position at sunset and possibly sunrise and related polarised light cues, stars and the geomagnetic field); therefore, the obtained information is redundant. This suggests that compasses of migratory birds must have certain hierarchical relationships and be calibrated. Currently, it is not known how avian compass calibration is accomplished. We report the results of our experiments with Garden Warblers Sylvia borin, long-distance songbird migrants. We tested the birds in two experimental conditions: in a local magnetic field with access to a starry sky (Control group) and in a vertical magnetic field that does not provide magnetic compass information with access to stars (Clear sky experimental group) or without it (Overcast experimental group), and analysed locomotor activity and orientation in all three groups. For the Garden Warblers from the control and experimental groups, we revealed two periods of activity separated by a quiescent period: twilight and nocturnal periods. The average direction for both periods of activity showed no significant difference in the control group. Birds from the experimental group were disoriented in both periods. Birds from the clear sky and overcast groups were also disoriented. These data suggest that long-distance songbird migrants, particularly the Garden Warbler, need information from the geomagnetic field, but not from the stars, at sunset and during twilight in order to choose the correct migratory direction. The nocturnal period of migratory activity probably represents actual migratory flight, while the nature of the twilight period remains unknown. The results of the present work and data from prior cue-conflict experiments on other species suggest that the twilight period may correspond to compass calibration activity.",non-battery

"In this article an economic and environmental study is carried out on PV solar energy installations connected to the Spanish electrical grid system. The study has been performed on installations situated in the city of Zaragoza (with an irradiation value approximately equal to the average value for Spain). Initially, an economical study is performed, proposing different scenarios where different values of interest rate and energy tariffs are considered. The following parameters are used to determine the profitability of a PV installation: the Net Present Value and the Pay-Back Period. Furthermore, the environmental benefits of PV systems connected to the grid have been evaluated. This has been accomplished using the Life Cycle Analysis theory of the systems, calculating the recuperation time of the invested energy, the contamination or emissions avoided and the externality costs. Finally the possible effects of the application of the Kyoto Protocol have been studied.",battery
"Battery inconsistency are exacerbated by the resistance of inter-cell connecting plate (RICP) and the input impedance of battery voltage monitoring system (IIBVMS), both of which cannot be eliminated in a battery pack. Experiments show that the inconsistency distribution and SOC deviation in a battery pack is restricted by RICP and IIBVMS. In this paper, a ??parallel-series?? battery pack model is proposed and validated. The effects of RICP and IIBVMS on SOC deviation are analyzed. Results indicate that RICP causes unevenly current flowing through each in-parallel battery cell, and so the battery cell directly connected to the battery module posts presents the lowest SOC. In order to restrict SOC deviation to an acceptable level, the equivalent relation of the battery inconsistency caused by RICP to the inherent inconsistency is discussed. The reasonable matching RICP is then presented. IIBVMS causes different current leakage in each voltage sampling line. The closer the battery module connects to the positive terminal of a battery pack, the higher leakage current is. The different leakage current in each voltage sampling line exacerbates battery inconsistency and causes different initial SOC for each battery module. The relationship among the leakage current, the input impedance and the number of in-series battery modules are discussed. And an improved schematic diagram of battery module voltage sampling is further presented to lower the leakage current and to solve the sampling time delay caused by the multi-switch.",battery
"We report (electro-)chemically stable, high temperature resistant and fast wetting Li-ion battery separators produced through a phase inversion process using novel polyetherimides (PEI) based on bisphenol-aceton diphthalic anhydride (BPADA) and para-phenylenediamine (pPD). In contrast to previous studies using PEI based on BPADA and meta-phenylenediamine (mPD), the separators reported herein show limited swelling in electrolytes and do not require fillers to render sufficient mechanical strength and ionic conductivity. In this work, the produced 15??25 ??m thick PEI-pPD separators show excellent electrolyte compatibility, proven by low degrees of swelling in electrolyte solvents, low contact angles, fast electrolyte wicking and high electrolyte uptake. The separators cover a tunable range of morphologies and properties, leading to a wide range of ionic conductivities as studied by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) demonstrated dimensional stability up to 220 ??C. Finally, single layer graphite/lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) pouch cells were assembled using this novel PEI-pPD separator, showing an excellent capacity retention of 89.3% after 1000 1C/2C cycles, with a mean Coulombic efficiency of 99.77% and limited resistance build-up. We conclude that PEI-pPD is a promising new material candidate for high performance separators.",battery
"The development of new materials is required to improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries. A new graphite type with optimised physical??chemical characteristics has been studied and developed to improve negative electrode performance. Lithium ion charge and discharge acceptance have been improved by the enhanced intrinsic properties of the material. The new material has higher efficiency electrode porosity/tortuosity, and increases electrical conductivity. This allows better charge performance at low temperatures and discharge performance at high rates. Combined with an optimised electrolyte composition, it also gives low and reproducible fading, good discharge performance in very low temperature conditions, and long term storage at high temperatures. Due to this and other design modifications that will be discussed, a 22% improvement in energy density is obtained in the new generation of Saft Li-ion medium prismatic cells (MP).",battery
"TiO2 mesoporous single crystals (MSCs) with diverse constructions in a controllable fashion are successfully fabricated by a new template-free method for the first time, using oxalic acid (OA) as the pore-forming agent and morphological controller. Unlike the seeding-template based growth mechanism, the TiO2 MSCs in the present work may involve a process of oriented aggregation and crystallographic fusion of primary nanocrystals. The structural control of TiO2 MSCs can be easily realized by tailoring growth conditions, such as Ti-source concentration and OA dosages. Moreover, the TiO2 MSCs shows substantial improvement in lithium specific capacity from 0.2C to 10C in comparison to the reference TiO2 nanoparticle. The high-rate performance was further improved by fabricating MSCs/graphene oxide nanocomposites, and specific capacity of the composite at the rate of 20C is as high as 90mAhg???1. This new template-free strategy may open up new and exciting opportunities for the preparation of other MSCs, and makes important applicatory significance for the structure design of high-rate lithium ion battery anodes.",battery
"Carbon??carbon (C??C) composite has been investigated as an anode for lithium-ion battery systems. The composite electrode delivers high reversible capacity and very low irreversible capacity loss. The test results of lithium-ion cells made with the C??C composite anode show many advantages, such as excellent performance and enhanced safety. The performance improvement is achieved because of strong mechanical integrity (cycle life) and absence of binder (shelf life) in C??C composite. The enhancement in safety comes from high thermal conductivity, fire retardant characteristics and an acceptable ability to overcharge and overdischarge.",battery

The paper argues that the findings on cultural influences on inference-making have implications for teaching and education generally, and specifically for the debate on conceptions and misconceptions of Asian students studying in western tertiary institutions around the world. The position defended is that, while there seems to be compelling empirical evidence for intercultural differences in thought patterns, these patterns are, for the most part, insignificant in everyday exchanges, though language and culture might subtlety modulate our inference-making at the margins. Linguistic determinism however is not defended. Nonetheless, the evidence provides food for thought, and it needs to inform the recent debates about international students studying overseas.",non-battery
"Managed artificial recharge (MAR) is a well-established practice for augmentation of depleted groundwater resources or for environmental benefit. At the St-Andr?? MAR site in the Belgian dune area, groundwater resources are optimised through re-use of highly treated wastewater by means of infiltration ponds. The very high quality of the infiltration water sets this system apart from other MAR systems. The low total dissolved solid (TDS) content in the infiltration water (less than 50??mg/L) compared to the dune aquifer (500??mg/L) triggers a number of reactions, increasing the TDS through soil-aquifer passage. Multi-component reactive transport modelling was applied to analyse the geochemical processes that occur. Carbonate dissolution is the main process increasing the TDS of the infiltration water. Oxic aquifer conditions prevail between the infiltration ponds and the extraction wells. This is driven by the high flow velocities, leaving no time to consume O2 between the ponds and extraction wells. Cation exchange is important when infiltration water is replaced by native dune water or when significant changes in infiltration-water quality occur. The seasonal variation of O2 and temperature in the infiltration water are the main drivers for seasonal changes in the concentration of all major ions.",non-battery

"A benzoquinone polymer is synthesized by the polymerisation of hydrobenzoquinone and formaldehyde, followed by oxidation process using a hydrogen peroxide to convert hydroquinone to quinone. As prepared materials are characterized with FTIR, 1H-13C CPMAS NMR, pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometer (MS), TGA-MS analysis, EDX, elemental analysis, XRD, SEM and TEM microscopies and BET nitrogen adsorption. The benzoquinone polymer shows an excellent electrochemical performance when used as a positive electrode material in Li-ion secondary batteries. Using an electrolyte consisting 1 M bis(trifluoromethane)-sulfonimide lithium salt dissolved in 1,3-dioxolane and dimethoxyethane in a vol. ratio 1:1 (1 M LiTFSI/DOL + DME = 1:1) a stable capacity close to 150 mAh/g can be obtained. Compared to other electroactive materials based on benzoquinones it has a supreme capacity stability and is prepared by a simple synthesis using easily accessible starting materials. Further improvements in the capacity value (up to the theoretical value of 406 mAh/g) can be foreseen by achieving a higher degree of oxidation and by modification of polymerization process to enhance the electronic and ionic conductivity.",battery
"Highly nonlinear structures and constituent materials and hazardous experiment situations have resulted in a pressing need for a numerical mechanical model for lithium-ion battery (LIB). However, such a model is still not well established. In this paper, an anisotropic homogeneous model describing the jellyroll and the battery shell is established and validated through compression, indentation, and bending tests at quasi-static loadings. In this model, state-of-charge (SOC) dependency of the LIB is further included through an analogy with the strain-rate effect. Moreover, with consideration of the inertia and strain-rate effects, the anisotropic homogeneous model is extended into the dynamic regime and proven capable of predicting the dynamic response of the LIB using the drop-weight test. The established model may help to predict extreme cases with high SOCs and crashing speeds with an over 135% improved accuracy compared to traditional models. The established coupled strain rate and SOC dependencies of the numerical mechanical model for the LIB aims to provide a solid step toward unraveling and quantifying the complicated problems for research on LIB mechanical integrity.",battery
"The present study reports on the direct synthesis of LiFePO4 nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets to form a composite cathode (LFP/GNs) in a one-step microwave-assisted polyol reaction. The polyol reaction induced by microwave irradiation for a few minutes produces nanocrystalline LFP and graphene nanosheets simultaneously from lithium, iron and phosphorus and carbon (5 wt% of graphite oxide) sources, respectively, used as starting precursors. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies on microwave-reacted sample obtained using just graphite oxide confirms the formation of graphene nanosheets separately. Whereas, electron microscopy studies on the LFP/GNs composite reveals that olivine nanoparticles of average sizes ranging between 5 and 20 nm are well-dispersed on the graphene nanosheets. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the LiFePO4/GNs nanocomposite cathodes registered enhanced discharge capacities (79 and 108 mAh g???1 for the as-prepared and annealed composite cathodes, respectively) at 32 C rates with good capacity retention capabilities. The AC impedance measurements confirm that the enhanced cathode properties of the LFP/GNs nanocomposite are ascribed to the improved electronic conductivity of the graphene nanosheets and the nano-sized particles. The slightly better electrochemical properties of the annealed LFP/GNs are attributed to its higher crystallinity.",battery
"The purpose of this study was to compare the cognitive profiles of men and women with clinically defined schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). We examined the neuropsychological profile of SPD in 26 right-handed females and 31 right-handed males who met DSM-IV criteria for SPD, and matched comparison subjects. Cognitive performance was assessed on measures of abstraction, verbal and spatial intelligence, learning and memory, language, attention, and motor skills. Neuropsychological profiles were constructed by standardizing test scores based on the means and standard deviations of comparison groups matched for sex, age, handedness, ethnicity and parental SES. Overall, SPD subjects showed mild, general decrements in performance in most cognitive domains. However, unlike male SPD subjects, female SPDs did not show relative deficits in verbal learning and abstraction. The results suggest a less severe pattern of cognitive deficits in women with SPD compared to men, consistent with hypotheses of gender differences in cognitive function in schizophrenia.",non-battery

"Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) and composite gel polymer electrolyte (CGPE) have been widely employed to improve the safety and cycling performance of rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion batteries. In order to determine whether this approach is applicable to lithium/sulfur (Li/S) battery, we examine the effect of CGPE on the cycling and storage performances of Li/S cells by comparing a 50PEO-50SiO2 (wt.%) composite coated separator (C-separator) with a pristine separator (P-separator). Results show that the composite coating significantly enhances the wettability of liquid electrolyte on the separator and that resulting CGPE can tightly glue the separator and electrode together. In comparison with the P-separator, the C-separator offers Li/S cells similar capacity retention and rate capability; however it greatly affects the specific capacity of sulfur. The analysis on the impedance spectrum of a lithium polysulfide (PS) solution reveal that the reduction of sulfur specific capacity is due to the high viscosity of the CGPE and the strong adsorption of SiO2 filler to the PS species, which trap PS species in the separator and hence reduce the utilization of sulfur active material. Therefore, the benefits of the GPE and CGPE to the Li/S batteries can be taken only at the expense of sulfur specific capacity.",battery
"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are large networks of tiny sensor nodes that are usually randomly distributed over a geographical region. The network topology may vary in time in an unpredictable manner due to many different causes. For example, in order to reduce power consumption, battery operated sensors undergo cycles of sleeping??active periods; additionally, sensors may be located in hostile environments increasing their likelihood of failure; furthermore, data might also be collected from a range of sources at different times. For this reason multi-hop routing algorithms used to route messages from a sensor node to a sink should be rapidly adaptable to the changing topology. Swarm intelligence has been proposed for this purpose, since it allows the emergence of a single global behavior from the interaction of many simple local agents. Swarm intelligent routing has been traditionally studied by resorting to simulation. The present paper aims to show that the recently proposed modeling technique, known as Markovian Agent Model (MAM), is suited for implementing swarm intelligent algorithms for large networks of interacting sensors. Various experimental results and quantitative performance indices are evaluated to support this claim. The validity of this approach is given a further proof by comparing the results with those obtained by using a WSN discrete event simulator.",non-battery

We present detailed morphology studies of PffBT4T-2OD based bulk heterojunction films deposited by the volume manufacturing compatible techniques of blade-coating and slot-die coating. Significant aspects of the film morphology, the average crystal domain orientation and the distribution of the characteristic phase separation length scales, are remarkably different when deposited by the scalable techniques vs. spun-coat. Yet, we find that optimized blade-coated devices achieve PCE > 9.5%, nearly the same as spun-coat. These results challenge some widely accepted propositions regarding what is an optimal BHJ morphology and suggest the hypothesis that diversity in the morphology that supports high performance may be a characteristic of manufacturable systems, those that maintain performance when coated thicker than ???200 nm. In situ measurements reveal the key differences in the solidification routes for spin- and blade-coating leading to the distinct film structures.

"Potassium-ion batteries are attracting great attention as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance and low price of potassium.

The suitable working voltage window for the amorphous Li12Si7 anode was determined to be 0.11???0.7V by analyzing the change in the charge transfer resistance using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. After 100 cycles, the capacity retention of the Li12Si7 electrode cycled at 0.11???0.7V increased to 57.6% from the 18.2% capacity retention obtained for the electrode cycled at 0.02???2.0V, representing more than a 2-fold enhancement. SEM observations displayed the limited pulverization and fracture for the electrode cycled at 0.11-0.7V, which is the most important reason for the improved cycling stability.
