    "prompt: Anionic Methacrylate Copolymer (AMC) is a fully polymerized copolymer used in the pharmaceutical industry as an enteric/delayed-release coating to permit the pH-dependent release of active ingredients in the gastrointestinal tract from oral dosage forms. This function is of potential use for food supplements. Oral administration of radiolabeled copolymer to rats resulted in the detection of chemically unchanged copolymer in the feces, with negligible absorption (<0.1%). AMC is therefore determined not to be bioavailable. Within a genotoxicity test battery AMC did not show any evidence of genotoxicity in bacteria and mammalian cells. Furthermore, no genotoxic effects occurred in vivo within a micronucleus test. There would therefore appear to be no safety concerns under intended conditions of oral use for the discussed toxicological endpoints.\n",

    "prompt: Allergic contact dermatitis is a common skin disease and is elicited by repeated skin contact with an allergen. In the regulatory context, currently only data from animal experiments are acceptable to assess the skin sensitizing potential of substances. Animal welfare and EU Cosmetic Directive/Regulation call for the implementation of animal-free alternatives for safety assessments. The mechanisms that trigger skin sensitization are complex and various steps are involved. Therefore, a single in vitro method may not be able to accurately assess this endpoint. Non-animal methods are being developed and validated and can be used for testing strategies that ensure a reliable prediction of skin sensitization potentials. In this study, the predictivities of four in vitro assays, one in chemico and one in silico method addressing three different steps in the development of skin sensitization were assessed using 54 test substances of known sensitizing potential. The predictivity of single tests and combinations of these assays were compared. These data were used to develop an in vitro testing scheme and prediction model for the detection of skin sensitizers based on protein reactivity, activation of the Keap-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway and dendritic cell activation.\n",

    "prompt: Patients with left hemisphere (LH) or right hemisphere (RH) brain injury due to stroke were tested on a speeded, color discrimination task in which two factors were manipulated: (1) the categorical relationship between the target and the distracters and (2) the visual field in which the target was presented. Similar to controls, the RH patients were faster in detecting targets in the right visual field when the target and distracters had different color names compared to when their names were the same. This effect was absent in the LH patients, consistent with the hypothesis that injury to the left hemisphere handicaps the automatic activation of lexical codes. Moreover, the LH patients showed a reversed effect, such that the advantage of different target??distracter names was now evident for targets in the left visual field. This reversal may suggest a reorganization of the color lexicon in the right hemisphere following left hemisphere brain injury and/or the unmasking of a heightened right hemisphere sensitivity to color categories.\n",

    "prompt: In this paper, we describe the evaluation of an automated in vitro micronucleus assay using CHO-K1 cells in 96-well plates. CHO-K1 cells were pre-loaded with a cell dye that stains the cytoplasm, after which the cells were treated with the test compounds for either 3h (for the +S9 condition) or 24h (for the ???S9 condition). A total of 10 concentrations were tested, of which the top five concentrations were scored (limited by either cytotoxicity or solubility). At the end of the incubation period the cells were fixed and their DNA was stained with Hoechst. The visualization and scoring of the cells was done using an automated fluorescent microscope coupled with proprietary automated image analysis software provided by Cellomics (Pittsburg, PA). A total of 46 compounds were used in this evaluation, including 8 aneugens and 25 clastogens with varied mechanisms of action. Thirteen non-genotoxic compounds were also included. The automated scoring had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%, with a predictive value positive of 100% and a predictive value negative of 76%, compared to data from the literature that was obtained with manual scoring. We also describe the incorporation of a metabolic activation system using rat liver S9 homogenates, and the use of cell number counts as a cytotoxicity index which is complementary to the CBPI- (cytokinesis-block proliferation index) based index. Finally, we also discuss the potential for artefactual findings due to fluorescent precipitate, which should be carefully monitored to prevent false positive results. In conclusion, the automated in vitro micronucleus scoring is a valid alternative to the manual scoring of slides, and it has the advantage of generating data in a rapid and consistent manner, and with low compound requirements, which makes it well suited as a screening assay in the early stages of compound development.\n",

    "prompt: Lithium oxide (Li2O) is activated in the presence of a layered composite cathode material (HEM) significantly increasing the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. The degree of activation depends on the current rate, electrolyte salt, and anode type. In full-cell tests, the Li2O was used as a lithium source to counter the first-cycle irreversibility of high-capacity composite alloy anodes. When Li2O is mixed with HEM to serve as a cathode, the electrochemical performance was improved in a full cell having an SiO-SnCoC composite as an anode. The mechanism behind the Li2O activation could also explain the first charge plateau and the abnormal high capacity associated with these high energy cathode materials.\n",

    "prompt: Hydrogen is a major industrial chemical whose manufacture is responsible for ???3% of global carbon dioxide emissions. >95% of hydrogen is made via reforming fossil fuels which typically co-produces hydrogen and waste carbon dioxide. Nearly all other hydrogen is co-produced with other commodity chemicals. Unfortunately, many alternative, clean hydrogen production processes are small-scale because they require major reductions in capital cost or energy prices to be economical enough for industry. Because the climate problem is urgent, and the economics of future energy is uncertain, this paper seeks to expand the options for producing industrial-scale, clean hydrogen under common, present-day economic conditions. First, we build a model to understand the economic and carbon dioxide emissions constraints of sulfur electrolysis which is an emerging process that cogenerates hydrogen and co-salable sulfuric acid and has the potential to produce up to 36% of the world's current hydrogen demand under present-day, average US economic conditions. We also use our model to evaluate water electrolysis, which cogenerates hydrogen and waste oxygen, but is not economical under present-day average US economic conditions. We then propose criteria for identifying clean hydrogen production chemistries. Using these criteria, we find enough reactions to have the combined potential to make over 150% of the world's industrial hydrogen needs under present-day, average US economic conditions while reducing cost and reducing or eliminating CO2 emissions. Given the urgency of the climate problem, we believe that an economic analysis, such as this is crucial to near-term CO2 emissions reductions.\n",

In the absence of Zn2+ ions in solution, a Tafel slope of 139mVdec???1 was obtained, a value close to that measured on bare platinum electrode (133mVdec???1) and ascribed to the limitation of the reaction rate by the first electron transfer. The main difference between the noble metal and the oxide electrode was a shift of the curves towards more negative potentials. In the presence of Zn2+ ions, the current density decreased significantly and the Tafel slope was measured at 282mVdec???1 showing that the electrode was partially blocked by zinc oxide formation reaction intermediates.\n",

    "prompt: Lithium non-stoichiometric Li[Li x (Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)1???x ]O2 materials (0??? x ???0.17) were synthesized using a spray drying method. The electrochemical properties and structural stabilities of the synthesized materials were investigated. The synthesized materials exhibited a hexagonal structure in all the x-value and the lattice parameters of the materials were gradually decreased with increasing x-value due to an increasing amount of Ni3+ ions for charge compensation. The capacity retention ability and rate capability of the stoichiometric Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 material were improved by increasing x-value, the so-called overlithiation. We found that the overlithiated materials could keep more structural integrity than the stoichiometric one during electrochemical cyclings, which could be one of reasons for a better electrochemical properties of the overlithiated materials.\n",

    "prompt: In the eastern province of Zambia, three companies for solar energy services have been operating for more than two years, with 400 clients paying for the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Clients do not become owners of the systems. Instead, the company continues to charge a fee for keeping the systems in operation. In this way, the useful lifetime of the solar systems is increased, and clients have local access to skilled service and spare parts. The fees for solar services cover the full operational costs of the companies, including battery replacement and makes them independent of further support from government or donors. Results to date show that clients are happy with their systems, which are of a standard solar home (SHS) size of 50 Wp, with four lights and a socket for radio or other light DC appliance. This is in spite of paying a higher price than what was previously spent on candles and kerosene for lighting. The most important benefit cited among the clients is that children now have the possibility to do their homework in the evening. The second most highly valued feature is entertainment, such as radio and video. Solar systems contribute to increased income earning opportunities especially in the service sector. The poorest rural people cannot afford to pay for a solar system in their house, but benefit from systems in the shops.\n",

    "prompt: Rechargeable Li-based electrochemical cells are regarded as the most promising candidate for electric vehicle (EV) applications.

In this paper, single phase of zirconium pyrovanadate ZrV2O7 was first synthesized via sol-gel method in a low sintering temperature of 500??C. The Li-absent mixed-metal-oxide ZrV2O7, previously regarded as negative thermal expansion (NTE) material only, revealed a high specific capacity of 282.6mAhg???1 and a voltage plateau of 2.48V vs. Li as potential cathode for rechargeable Li batteries.

Gender of the photo rater and pulling topography affected the criterion validity of photographic assessment (partial ??2?\\x80?=?\\x80?0.05?\\x80?0.11). Recommendations for improving photographic assessment and future directions for hair pulling research are discussed.'}]\n",

    "prompt: Self - organization of monodisperse nanoscale building blocks into ordered arrays represents a facile and versatile route for metamaterials with rationally modulated properties . In particular , liquid - crystalline - type superstructures or superlattices composed of anisotropic nanocrystals have attracted a fast - growing interest due to the rich phase behaviors resulting from the added complexity of shape anisotropy and the potential for emergent collective properties . Here we explore the intriguing shape - dependent packing symmetry of ordered NR assemblies by slow evaporation of concentrated gold NR aqueous solutions at room temperature . Onsager ’s theory on the assembly behavior of hard rodlike colloids shows that above a critical concentration of rods there is a net gain in entropy on transition from isotropic random packing to a nematic liquid crystalline phase . As shown in Figure 10 , large - area smectic phases form in dense NR solids , where NRs self - organize into close - packed layers and adjacent layers align nearly parallel into ordered superstructures . AFM studies confirm the three - dimensional nature of gold NR assemblies with a typical domain size of ∼10 μm2 ( Figures 10i , S43 ) . AFM height analysis along layers of smectic phases reveals periodic height modulation with a periodicity of 28.0 ± 2.5 nm ( the NR diameter is measured to be 22.0 ± 1.0 nm from TEM images ) , which is consistent with recent experimental studies showing partially interdigitated CTAB bilayers on the gold NR surface ( Figure 10j , k ) . Moreover , the surfaces of gold NR assemblies are not perfectly flat but exhibit height variations corresponding to one or two layers of gold NRs ( Figure 10j , k ) , which could be advantageous for surface - enhanced spectroscopy due to the increased accessibility of local hot - spots . However , because of the drying process on a solid substrate ( TEM grid in this case ) , fluctuations in the local NR concentration are expected and the extent of spatial ordering for monodisperse gold NRs is largely limited by the area over which a uniform concentration of NRs can be maintained during the very last stage of deposition . Indeed , this is reflected by the coexistence of smectic and nematic phases on a single TEM grid for gold NRs of various aspect ratios . The nematic phase , characterized by a uniaxial orientational order and lack of positional order , usually forms at less concentrated regions and is more common for NRs of larger aspect ratios ( Figures S47–S49 ) . Interestingly , for gold NRs with an aspect ratio less than 4.0 , bilayered motifs exhibiting approximately centered - rectangular local packing symmetry are routinely observed ( Figures S35 , S36 , S39 , and S45 ) , which has been rarely seen in other NR assemblies . Moreover , the nematic or smectic ordering can be disrupted through continuous bending of neighboring layers , reminiscent of nonequilibrium drying and complex interactions between the NRs ( Figure 10e , f ) . Those wavy gold nanorod assemblies have also been reported by Murphy et al . and referred to as “ swirling clustering ” or “ end - to - end cementing ” . Therefore , theories on the packing of hard rods under equilibrium conditions can not fully explain the observed structural complexity of gold NR assemblies , and development of a rigorous framework taking into account not only entropic contributions but also nanoscale forces including van der Waals attractions , electrostatic repulsions , dipole – dipole interactions , and , in particular , the role of CTAB layers and counterion interaction in self - assembling gold nanorods is needed .  ==>\\n\n",

Onsager ’s theory on the assembly behavior of hard rodlike colloids shows that above a critical concentration of rods there is a net gain in entropy on transition from isotropic random packing to a nematic liquid crystalline phase . As shown in Figure 10 , large - area smectic phases form in dense NR solids , where NRs self - organize into close - packed layers and adjacent layers align nearly parallel into ordered superstructures . AFM studies confirm the three - dimensional nature of gold NR assemblies with a typical domain size of ∼10 μm2 ( Figures 10i , S43 ) . AFM height analysis along layers of smectic phases reveals periodic height modulation with a periodicity of 28.0 ± 2.5 nm ( the NR diameter is measured to be 22.0 ± 1.0 nm from TEM images ) , which is consistent with recent experimental studies showing partially interdigitated CTAB bilayers on the gold NR surface ( Figure 10j , k ) . Moreover , the surfaces of gold NR assemblies are not perfectly flat but exhibit height variations corresponding to one or two layers of gold NRs ( Figure 10j , k ) , which could be advantageous for surface - enhanced spectroscopy due to the increased accessibility of local hot - spots . However , because of the drying process on a solid substrate ( TEM grid in this case ) , fluctuations in the local NR concentration are expected and the extent of spatial ordering for monodisperse gold NRs is largely limited by the area over which a uniform concentration of NRs can be maintained during the very last stage of deposition . Indeed , this is reflected by the coexistence of smectic and nematic phases on a single TEM grid for gold NRs of various aspect ratios . The nematic phase , characterized by a uniaxial orientational order and lack of positional order , usually forms at less concentrated regions and is more common for NRs of larger aspect ratios ( Figures S47–S49 ) .

    "prompt = \"High energy density lithium ion batteries have been applied as the main energy storage technology in portable devices and green transportation. LiCoO2, a layered oxide cathode in lithium ion batteries, has obtained unprecedented success since its commercialization in the 1990s. LiNiO2, isostructural to LiCoO2, can deliver a higher capacity within a relatively low upper cutoff voltage. However, its practical application has been hindered due to the inherent structural instability. Thus, cobalt, as an essential element, has been incorporated into the LiNiO2 system to form LiNi1−x−yMnyCoxO2 (NMC) and LiNi1−x−yCoxAlyO2 (NCA) materials to release the strong magnetic moment and ultimately stabilize the structure. At present, researchers are pursuing the theoretical capacity of NMCs either by elevating the high cutoff voltage or increasing the nickel concentration. However, these strategies have inevitably provoked some of the degradation pathways of these materials, including transition metal reduction/dissolution, surface reconstruction, gas evolution, electrolyte oxidation/decomposition, and chemomechanical breakdown. Additionally, most of these materials are synthesized in the polycrystalline form and have heterogeneous chemistry, resulting in high heterogeneous degradation patterns.\"\n",
